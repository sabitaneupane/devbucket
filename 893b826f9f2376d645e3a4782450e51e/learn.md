## Day 2: Naming Variables and Functions
### Naming Variables and Functions: Best Practices for Improved Understandability.

> Make our code speak for itself! Master the art of naming variables and functions for improved understandability and clean code.

Descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes are essential to writing clean code. Proper naming helps reduce maintenance and debugging time and makes code easier to read and understand. Accurate reflection of a variable or function's purpose through its name is a crucial aspect of clean coding.

### Best practices for naming variables and functions:

- **Choose descriptive and meaningful names:** Select names that accurately describe the purpose of variables, functions, and classes.
- **Adhere to naming conventions:** Follow a consistent naming convention to make it easier for others to understand our code.
- **Use clear and concise names:** Use short and simple names for variables, functions, and classes for improved readability.
- **Indicate type or scope:** Use prefixes or suffixes to indicate type or scope, e.g. "is*" for booleans and "get*" or "set\_" for accessing values.
- **Avoid abbreviations:** Avoid abbreviations, especially if they are not widely understood, to improve understandability.
- **Be consistent:** Be consistent in our naming style and avoid switching between different styles.
- **Use verb phrases for functions:** Use verb phrases to name functions, indicating the action they perform.
- **Use nouns for variables:** Use nouns to name variables, indicating the data they hold.
- **Use camelCase or snake_case:** Use either camelCase or snake_case to name variables and functions, depending on our naming convention.

By following the best practices for naming variables and functions, we can significantly improve the understandability and readability of our code, leading to better maintenance and fewer bugs.

### Clean Code Examples

#### Example 1:

- Here are some guidelines to consider when naming:

##### Bad Code

```JS
// Variables in abbreviated
var cName = "John Doe";
var cAddress = "123 Main St";
var cTotal = 50;

// Functions with not clear meaning and intention
function discount(t) {
  return t * 0.1;
}

function orderDetails(n, a, t) {
  console.log("Cus Name: " + n);
  console.log("Cus Addr: " + a);
  console.log("Ord Tot: $" + t);
  console.log("Disc: $" + discount(t));
}

orderDetails(cN, cA, oT);

```

##### Clean Code

```JS
// Variables in camelCase and avoiding abbreviations
var customerName = "John Doe";
var customerAddress = "123 Main St";
var orderTotal = 50;

// Functions in camelCase and with clear meaning and intention
function calculateDiscount(total) {
  return total * 0.1;
}

function displayOrderDetails(name, address, total) {
  console.log("Customer Name: " + name);
  console.log("Customer Address: " + address);
  console.log("Order Total: $" + total);
  console.log("Discount: $" + calculateDiscount(total));
}

displayOrderDetails(customerName, customerAddress, orderTotal);

```

#### Example 2:

- When we execute the code, it displays the number `9` as output. However, understanding why it displays `9` requires some examination. We see that a method called `a()` is called and passed the values `5` and `4`. However, it is not immediately clear from reading this line what the method does with these values. While we could try to make an educated guess based on the output, it is better to dig deeper and view the definition of the method to get a clearer understanding of its purpose.

##### Bad Code

```JavaScript

const a = (b, c) => {
    return b + c
}

console.log(a(5,4))

```

##### Clean Code

```JavaScript

const sum = (num1, num2) => { // changing b to num1 and c to num2
    return num1 + num2
}

console.log(sum(5,4)) // changing a to sum

```

#### Example 3:

- It may be tempting to use short and concise names when writing code, as it requires fewer characters to type and the computer can still understand the meaning. However, it's important to remember that the primary audience for our code is human and thus, we should prioritize using clear and descriptive names over concise ones. A common area where overly brief names are used is in code that iterates through an array. To improve the readability and understandability of our code for human readers, it's important to choose clear names over brief ones.

##### Bad Code

```JavaScript
const fruits = [
    "apple",
    "banana",
    "orange"
]

for (let i=0; i<fruits.length; i++){
    const f = fruits[i];
    console.log(f);
}

```

##### Clean Code

```JavaScript

const fruits = [
    "apple",
    "banana",
    "orange"
]

for (let i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++){
    const fruit = fruits[i]; // changing f to fruit
    console.log(fruit);
}

```

#### Example 4:

- Here are some guidelines to consider when naming our `classes`:

##### Bad Code

```JavaScript
// Avoid verb forms
class Perform {}
class Performed {}
class Performing {}

// Avoid adjectives
class Huge {}
class Small {}
class Fast {}
class Slow {}

// Avoid Vague prefixes
class MyPerformer {}
class APerformer {}
class ThePerformer {}
class ThisPerformer {}

// Avoid single letter class names
class P {}

// Avoid single letter prefixes
class CPerformer {}
class TPerformer {}

// Avoid all capital acronyms
class HTTPAPIPerformer {}

// Avoid abbrevations
class Perf {}

// Avoid lower case capitalization
class performer {}

// Avoid plural on normal class
class Performers {}

```

##### Clean Code

```JavaScript
// Prefer nouns for class names
class Performer {}
class Performance {}

// Prefer Adjective prefixes to convey time
class ActivePerformance {}
class PastPerformance {}

// Prefer Adjective prefixes to a noun
class SmallPerformance {}
class FastPerformance {}

// Prefer format easier to see boundary between acronyms
class HttpApiPerformer {}

```

#### Example 5:

- Here are some rules to follow when naming `functions and methods`:

##### Bad Code

```JavaScript
// Avoid gerunds (ing)
const performing () => {}
const opening () => {}
const closing () => {}
const validating () => {}

// Avoid past tense verb forms
const performed () => {}
const opened () => {}
const closed () => {}
const validated () => {}
```

##### Clean Code

```JavaScript
// Prefer present tense verbs for method names
const perform () => {}
const open () => {}
const close () => {}
const validate () => {}

// Prefer gerunds (ing) with `is`
const isPerforming () => {}
const isOpening () => {}
const isClosing () => {}
const isvalidating () => {}

// Prefer to prefix past tense with `has`
const hasPerformed () => {}
const hasOpened () => {}
const hasCLosed () => {}
const hasValidated () => {}

```

#### Example 6:

- Here are some rules to follow when naming `variable` names:
  - When naming variables that store primitive type values or object references, it is best to use singular nouns to indicate that the variable only contains one value.
  - When naming variables that store arrays or other collections, it is best to use plural nouns to indicate that the variable contains multiple values.

##### Bad Code

```JavaScript
// Avoid verbs for variables that store primitive types
const perform = 12;
const create = false;

// Avoid single letter variable name
let t = 12;
let i = 8;

// Avoid using confusing acronyms and abbreviations
const dbsqlSelAllNames = "select * from names";

// Avoid complicated prefixes
const f_strFirstname = "John"

// Avoid using type name as a suffix
const lastNameString = "Doe"
```

##### Clean Code

```JavaScript
// Prefer singular nouns for primitive types
const name = "John"

// Prefer plural nouns for arrays
const names = ["John", "Linda", "Sam"]

// Prefer making nouns for variables that store primitive types
const performanceCode = 12;
const creationEnabled = false;

// Prefer using meaningful words
let testCode = 12;
let index = 8;

// Prefer using seperate acronyms and spell out abbreviations
const dbSqlSelectAllNames = "select * from names";

// Prefer using simple variable names
const firstname = "John"
const lastName = "Doe"
```

## Day 3: Avoiding Redundancy

### Avoiding Redundancy: The Significance of Keeping Your Code DRY.

> Duplicate code is a waste of time and resources. Embrace the power of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) to improve code quality and efficiency.

Adhering to the DRY principle helps minimize redundant code and promotes the creation of clean and efficient code. Duplicate code can lead to difficulties in maintenance and increase the risk of bugs. To ensure code remains maintainable and efficient, it is important to follow DRY principles, such as SOLID and KISS, and write modular code that can be easily reused.

### Advantages of DRY code:

- Maintaining code becomes easier and faster, reducing the need for repetitive updates and bug fixes.
- DRY code is clearer and more readable, without unnecessary duplicated information.
- DRY code also runs more efficiently, reducing unnecessary computation.
- By avoiding duplicate code, the risk of bugs is reduced, leading to improved code quality.

### Tips and technique:

- **Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle:** Eliminate duplicated code by extracting common functionality into separate functions or classes.
- **Use functions or classes to encapsulate related behavior:** Group related functionality into functions or classes for improved organization and maintenance.
- **Identify and eliminate duplicate code:** Regularly scan the code for duplicates and eliminate them to increase efficiency and maintainability.
- **Make use of libraries and frameworks:** Reuse code from libraries and frameworks where possible to reduce redundancy.
- **Utilize version control:** Use version control to track changes and revert to previous versions if necessary.
- **Refactor complex code:** Refactor complex or hard-to-understand code into smaller, more manageable pieces.
- **Adhere to design patterns:** Use design patterns to standardize the structure and organization of the code.
- **Implement SOLID principles:** Implement the SOLID principles of object-oriented design to improve the structure and organization of the code.

By adhering to the DRY principle and implementing effective techniques for avoiding redundancy, you can improve the quality, efficiency, and maintainability of your code, while reducing the risk of bugs.

### Tools

There are several tools that can help with avoiding redundancy in code, including:

- **Linting tools:** `ESLint`, `JSLint`, or `JSHint` to detect duplicate or redundant code and suggest improvements.
- **Source control systems:** `Git` that allow you to track changes to your code and detect when similar code changes are made in multiple places.
- **Code editor plugins or extensions that provide features:** such as `"Find all references"` or `"Rename Symbol"` to help you refactor code and avoid redundant code.

By using these tools, you can help keep your code dry and maintainable

### Clean Code Examples

#### Example 1:

- Reusing functions:

```JS
function getUserDetails(userId) {
  // code to fetch user details from database
}

function displayUserDetails(userId) {
  const userDetails = getUserDetails(userId);
  // code to display user details on the page
}

```

Instead of duplicating the code to fetch user details in both functions, we can extract the common functionality into a separate function and call it in both places.

#### Example 2:

- Extraction of common logic into a base class:

```JS
class Animal {
  move() {
    console.log("Animal is moving");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  move() {
    console.log("Dog is running");
  }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
  move() {
    console.log("Cat is running");
  }
}

```

Instead of duplicating the code to print the message for each animal, we can extract the common logic into a base class and reuse it in the derived classes.

#### Example 3:

- Use of configuration files:

```JS
const databaseConfig = {
  host: "localhost",
  user: "root",
  password: "secret",
  database: "mydb"
};

function connectToDatabase() {
  // code to connect to database using the config
}

function fetchDataFromDatabase() {
  // code to fetch data from database
}

```

Instead of duplicating the database configuration in multiple functions, we can extract it into a separate file or constant and reuse it whenever required.

These are just a few examples of how you can apply the DRY principle to your code. The idea is to eliminate duplicated code and improve the maintainability and efficiency of your code.

#### Example 4:

##### Bad Code

```JS
// Duplicate code to calculate the area of a rectangle
function calculateAreaRectangle1(width, height) {
  return width * height;
}

function calculateAreaRectangle2(width, height) {
  return width * height;
}

// Duplicate code to calculate the area of a circle
function calculateAreaCircle1(radius) {
  return Math.PI * radius * radius;
}

function calculateAreaCircle2(radius) {
  return Math.PI * radius * radius;
}

```

##### Clean Code

```JS
// Reusable function to calculate the area of a shape
function calculateArea(shape, ...dimensions) {
  switch(shape) {
    case 'rectangle':
      return dimensions[0] * dimensions[1];
    case 'circle':
      return Math.PI * dimensions[0] * dimensions[0];
    default:
      return 0;
  }
}

// Usage of the reusable function
console.log(calculateArea('rectangle', 10, 20));
console.log(calculateArea('circle', 5));

```

In the bad code example, we have duplicate functions for calculating the area of a rectangle and a circle. This can lead to maintenance difficulties, as changes made to one function might not be reflected in the other. In the clean code example, we have a single reusable function that can calculate the area of any shape, as long as we provide the necessary parameters. This approach reduces redundancy and makes the code easier to maintain.

#### Example 5:

##### Bad Code

```JS
function calculateTotal(amount) {
  let tax = amount * 0.1;
  let total = amount + tax;
  return total;
}

function calculateDiscountedTotal(amount) {
  let tax = amount * 0.1;
  let discount = amount * 0.2;
  let total = amount + tax - discount;
  return total;
}

```

##### Clean Code

```JS
function calculateTax(amount) {
  return amount * 0.1;
}

function calculateTotal(amount) {
  let tax = calculateTax(amount);
  return amount + tax;
}

function calculateDiscountedTotal(amount) {
  let tax = calculateTax(amount);
  let discount = amount * 0.2;
  return amount + tax - discount;
}

```

In the first example, the calculation for tax is duplicated in both functions, which violates the DRY principle. In the second example, the calculation for tax has been extracted into a separate function, making the code more maintainable and efficient.

#### Example 6:

##### Bad Code

```JS
function displayMessage(message) {
  console.log(message);
  alert(message);
}

function displayErrorMessage(message) {
  console.error(message);
  alert(message);
}

```

##### Clean Code

```JS
function displayMessage(message, type) {
  if (type === 'error') {
    console.error(message);
  } else {
    console.log(message);
  }
  alert(message);
}

displayMessage('This is a message', 'log');
displayMessage('This is an error', 'error');

```

In the first example, the logic for displaying a message is duplicated in both functions. In the second example, the logic has been extracted into a single function, with an additional parameter to specify the type of message. This makes the code more modular, maintainable, and efficient.

## Day 4: Self-Documenting and Self-Explanatory Code

### Self-Documenting and Self-Explanatory Code - Writing Code that Tells Its Own Story.

> Code that tells its own story? Yes, it's possible! Learn the art of writing self-documenting and self-explanatory code for a better understanding.

Clean, easy-to-understand code helps with maintenance and modification. Code should convey its purpose clearly, reducing need for comments and documentation. Best practices for self-documenting code include descriptive names, concise code, and SOLID/KISS principles. This leads to code that's easy to understand.

### Create clean, organized, and readable code through self-documenting techniques:

- **Use descriptive and meaningful naming conventions:** Choose names that accurately describe the purpose of variables, functions, and classes.
- **Document code:** Document the code with meaningful comments and inline documentation to help others understand its behavior.
- **Provide comments:** Provide comments and documentation to enhance the self-explanatory nature of the code.
- **Adhere to design patterns:** Use design patterns to standardize the structure and organization of the code.
- **Make use of SOLID principles:** Implement the SOLID principles of object-oriented design to improve the structure and organization of the code.
- **Organize code:** Divide code into functional files or modules for improved navigation and easy access to relevant code.

By following the principles of self-documenting and self-explanatory code, you can improve the readability and understandability of your code, making it easier for others to maintain and reducing the time and effort required for debugging and updates.

### Tools

There are several tools that can assist with writing self-documenting and self-explanatory code, including:

- **Linting tools:** `ESLint`, `JSLint`, or `JSHint` to help enforce coding standards and best practices for writing clear and concise code.
- **Code profiling tools:** the `Chrome DevTools performance tab` or the `JavaScript profiler` in Node.js to identify performance bottlenecks in your code, which can make it easier to understand how your code is functioning.
- **Documentation generators:** `JSDoc` or `Doxygen` to automate the generation of code documentation and help identify redundant code.

By using these tools, you can write code that is easy to understand, maintain, and debug, making it easier for others (or future you) to pick up and work with your code.

### Clean Code Examples

#### Examples 1:

- Descriptive naming conventions

##### Bad Code

```JS
var x = 5;
var y = 10;

function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

```

In this example, the variables `x` and `y` have unclear names and the function `add` does not accurately describe what it does. This makes the code difficult to understand and maintain.

##### Clean Code

```JS
var numberOfUsers = 5;
var maxUsers = 10;

function calculateSum(firstNumber, secondNumber) {
    return firstNumber + secondNumber;
}

```

In this example, the variables `numberOfUsers` and `maxUsers` have descriptive names and the function `calculateSum` accurately describes what it does. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

#### Examples 2:

- Comments or documentation

##### Bad Code

```JS
function complexCalculation(a, b, c) {
    var x = a * b;
    var y = x / c;
    return y + c;
}

```

In this example, the function `complexCalculation` does not have any comments or documentation, making it difficult to understand what it does and how it works.

##### Clean Code

```JS
/**
 * Calculates the average of three numbers.
 * @param {number} firstNumber
 * @param {number} secondNumber
 * @param {number} thirdNumber
 * @return {number}
 */
function calculateAverage(firstNumber, secondNumber, thirdNumber) {
    var sum = firstNumber + secondNumber + thirdNumber;
    return sum / 3;
}

```

In this example, the function `calculateAverage` has comments and documentation, making it clear what it does and how it works.

## Day 5: Refactoring and Organizing code for Better Structure

### Refactoring and Organizing code for Better Structure: Techniques for Improving Existing Code

> Don't reinvent the wheel, refactor it! Enhance the structure of your existing code with tips for successful refactoring.

Refactoring is a technique for enhancing the design of existing code without altering its functionality. The goal is to make code more maintainable, readable, and scalable by restructuring it. Some common methods include breaking down large functions into smaller, reusable parts, using design patterns to simplify complex logic, and removing duplicated code. Regular refactoring helps keep code organized and prevents code rot, making it easier to add new features and fix bugs.

### Benefits of refactoring:

- Improved code readability, making it easier for others to understand and maintain.
- More efficient code that is less prone to bugs and easier to maintain over time.
- Better organization, making it easier to locate and fix issues.

### Refactoring and code organization tips:

- **Refactor complex code:** Break down complex or hard-to-understand code into smaller, manageable pieces.
- **Create classes:** Group related data and behavior with new classes for better organization.
- **Simplify conditionals:** Enhance understandability with simpler conditional statements.
- **Use interfaces:** Ensure consistency with contracts for related classes defined by interfaces.
- **Clear iteration:** Enhance understandability with simple, clear looping and iteration constructs.
- **Remove unused code:** Reduce complexity and improve maintainability by removing unused code.
- **Identify code smells:** Address common issues such as long functions, duplicated code, or complex control flow by identifying code smells.
- **Use refactoring tools:** Make code changes in many IDEs with automated refactoring tools.
- **Refactor duplicated code:** Eliminate duplicate code by extracting common functionality into functions or classes.
- **Use code linting:** Enforce coding standards and identify issues with a code linting tool.
- **Track changes with version control:** Use version control to track changes and revert to previous versions if necessary.
- **Document code:** Enhance code understandability with meaningful comments and documentation.
- **Optimize performance:** Improve code performance by profiling and optimizing critical parts.

By embracing these best practices, you can improve the structure and organization of your code, leading to enhanced readability, maintainability, and efficiency while reducing maintenance and bug-fixing costs.

### Tools

There are several tools that can assist with refactoring and organizing code for better structure, including:

- **Code editor plugins with refactoring tools:** options like `"Refactor"` or `"Organize"` found in popular code editors like Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ.
- **Source control systems:** `Git` for tracking changes to your code and collaborating with others.
- **Linting tools:** such as `ESLint`, `JSLint`, or `JSHint` to enforce coding standards and detect potential errors.
- **Code formatting tools:** `Prettier` for automating code formatting to ensure consistency and readability.

By using these tools, you can improve the structure and maintainability of your existing code, and ensure that it is up-to-date and follows best practices.

### Clean Code Examples

#### Examples 1:

- Large Functions

##### Bad Code

```JS
function calculateTotal(items) {
  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
    total += items[i].price * items[i].quantity;
  }
  if (total > 100) {
    total = total * 0.9;
  }
  return total;
}

```

This function is a classic example of a large function that performs multiple tasks, such as calculating the total and applying a discount. This makes it difficult to maintain and test.

##### Clean Code

```JS
function calculateSubtotal(item) {
  return item.price * item.quantity;
}

function applyDiscount(total) {
  return total > 100 ? total * 0.9 : total;
}

function calculateTotal(items) {
  return applyDiscount(
    items.reduce((total, item) => total + calculateSubtotal(item), 0)
  );
}
```

This code has been refactored into smaller, more manageable functions. Each function performs a specific task, making it easier to maintain and test.

#### Examples 2:

- Duplicate Code

##### Bad Code

```JS
function sendNotification(message, type) {
  if (type === "email") {
    console.log(`Sending email: ${message}`);
  } else if (type === "sms") {
    console.log(`Sending sms: ${message}`);
  } else {
    console.log(`Invalid notification type`);
  }
}

function sendNotification(message, type) {
  if (type === "email") {
    console.log(`Sending email: ${message}`);
  } else if (type === "sms") {
    console.log(`Sending sms: ${message}`);
  } else {
    console.log(`Invalid notification type`);
  }
}

```

This code contains duplicate functions, which is an example of bad code. Duplicate code makes it difficult to maintain, as changes must be made in multiple places, and increases the risk of bugs.

##### Clean Code

```JS
function sendNotification(message, type) {
  switch (type) {
    case "email":
      console.log(`Sending email: ${message}`);
      break;
    case "sms":
      console.log(`Sending sms: ${message}`);
      break;
    default:
      console.log(`Invalid notification type`);
      break;
  }
}

```

This code has been refactored to eliminate duplicate code, making it easier to maintain and less prone to bugs.

#### Examples 3:

- Lack of Documentation

##### Bad Code

```JS
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

```

This code does not contain any documentation, making it difficult for others to understand its purpose and behavior.

##### Clean Code

```JS
/**
 * Calculates the sum of two numbers
 *
 * @param {number} a - The first number
 * @param {number} b - The second number
 * @returns {number} The sum of the
```

### What is Code Smell

Code smell is a term used to describe certain characteristics of code that may indicate deeper problems. It's not a precise technical term, but rather a way to describe patterns or characteristics in code that are indicative of underlying problems, such as poor design, lack of maintainability, or the need for refactoring.

Code smells can take many different forms, but some common examples include:

- **Duplicate code**: Code that is duplicated multiple times within the same program, or even across multiple programs.
- **Long methods**: Methods that are excessively long and complex, and may be difficult to understand or maintain.
- **Large classes**: Classes that are overly large and contain a lot of code, which can make them difficult to understand and maintain.
- **Spaghetti code**: Code that is poorly organized and structured, making it difficult to understand or maintain.
- **Lack of modularity**: Code that is not modular, meaning it is not organized into smaller, independent units that can be easily reused and tested.

**Code smells are not necessarily errors or bugs**, but they can indicate deeper problems with the design or structure of the code, and may indicate the need for refactoring or redesigning the code. Identifying and addressing code smells can help improve the quality, maintainability, and overall health of a codebase.

#### Example of Code Smell

Here is an example of code smell in the form of a large, monolithic function in JavaScript:

```JavaScript
function processOrder(order) {
  // check that all required fields are present
  if (!order.customerName) {
    return 'error: customer name is required';
  }
  if (!order.productId) {
    return 'error: product id is required';
  }
  if (!order.quantity) {
    return 'error: quantity is required';
  }
  if (!order.shippingAddress) {
    return 'error: shipping address is required';
  }
  // retrieve product details
  const product = getProduct(order.productId);
  if (!product) {
    return 'error: invalid product id';
  }
  if (order.quantity > product.quantityAvailable) {
    return 'error: not enough product in stock';
  }
  // calculate total cost
  const totalCost = order.quantity * product.price;
  // create shipping label
  const shippingLabel = createShippingLabel(order.customerName, order.shippingAddress);
  // update product quantity
  updateProductQuantity(order.productId, -order.quantity);
  // send confirmation email
  sendConfirmationEmail(order.customerName, product.name, totalCost, shippingLabel);
  return 'order processed successfully';
}

```

This function is responsible for processing an order and is excessively long, making it difficult to understand and maintain. It also contains a number of different responsibilities, such as checking that required fields are present, retrieving product details, calculating the total cost, creating a shipping label, updating product quantity, and sending a confirmation email. These responsibilities could be separated into different functions, which would make the code easier to understand and maintain.

### What is Design Smell

Design smell is a term used to describe certain characteristics of a software design that may indicate deeper problems. It is similar to code smell, but refers specifically to problems with the overall design or architecture of a software system, rather than specific patterns or characteristics of the code itself.

Design smells can take many different forms, but some common examples include:

- **Tight coupling**: This refers to a design in which different components of the system are closely connected and dependent on one another, making it difficult to change or modify any one component without affecting the others.
- **Poor encapsulation**: This refers to a design in which the internal details of a component are exposed to the rest of the system, making it difficult to modify or maintain the component without affecting the rest of the system.
- **Lack of modularity**: This refers to a design in which the system is not divided into smaller, independent modules or components that can be easily reused and tested.
- **Lack of separation of concerns**: This refers to a design in which different concerns or responsibilities are not properly separated, making it difficult to understand and maintain the system.

Design smells can indicate deeper problems with the design or architecture of a software system, and addressing them can help improve the quality, maintainability, and overall health of the system.

#### Example of Design Smell

Here is an example of design smell in the form of tight coupling in a JavaScript application:

```JavaScript
class OrderProcessor {
  constructor(database) {
    this.database = database;
  }

  processOrder(order) {
    // check that all required fields are present
    if (!order.customerName) {
      return 'error: customer name is required';
    }
    if (!order.productId) {
      return 'error: product id is required';
    }
    if (!order.quantity) {
      return 'error: quantity is required';
    }
    if (!order.shippingAddress) {
      return 'error: shipping address is required';
    }
    // retrieve product details
    const product = this.database.getProduct(order.productId);
    if (!product) {
      return 'error: invalid product id';
    }
    if (order.quantity > product.quantityAvailable) {
      return 'error: not enough product in stock';
    }
    // calculate total cost
    const totalCost = order.quantity * product.price;
    // create shipping label
    const shippingLabel = this.createShippingLabel(order.customerName, order.shippingAddress);
    // update product quantity
    this.database.updateProductQuantity(order.productId, -order.quantity);
    // send confirmation email
    this.sendConfirmationEmail(order.customerName, product.name, totalCost, shippingLabel);
    return 'order processed successfully';
  }
}

class Database {
  constructor() {
    this.products = [];
  }

  getProduct(id) {
    return this.products.find(product => product.id === id);
  }

  updateProductQuantity(id, quantity) {
    const product = this.getProduct(id);
    product.quantityAvailable += quantity;
  }
}

const database = new Database();
const orderProcessor = new OrderProcessor(database);

```

In this example, the `OrderProcessor` class is tightly coupled to the `Database` class, as it depends on an instance of `Database` being passed to it in its constructor and makes direct calls to its methods. This means that if the implementation of `Database` changes, it could break the `OrderProcessor` class, and it would be difficult to test or reuse the `OrderProcessor` class without also including the `Database` class. To address this design smell, the `OrderProcessor` class could be refactored to use a database interface, which would allow it to be more flexible and easier to test and reuse.

## Day 8: Code Formatting and Layout

### Code Formatting and Layout: Best Practices for Consistent and Clear Code

> Code formatting and layout are the unsung heroes of clean code, often overlooked but critical for creating clear and readable code. Learn tips for achieving consistent and clear formatting and layout.

Formatting and layout have a significant impact on the readability and maintainability of code. Good formatting requires consistent indentation, whitespace, naming conventions, and clear variable names. Effective layout involves organizing code into logical sections and using appropriate comments and whitespace to distinguish different parts of the code. Adhering to best practices in formatting and layout results in code that is easier to read, understand, and maintain, leading to better overall code quality.

### Tips and Techniques for Achieving Consistent and Clear Code Formatting and Layout

- **Consistent indentation:** Use a consistent indentation style (e.g. 2 spaces, 4 spaces) throughout your code to indicate the structure and hierarchy of the code.
- **Appropriate whitespace:** Use whitespace to separate different parts of the code and make it easier to read.
- **Naming conventions:** Use meaningful, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes that follow a consistent naming convention (e.g. CamelCase, snake_case).
- **Clear variable names:** Use clear and descriptive variable names that accurately reflect their purpose and value.
- **Logical grouping:** Organize code into logical groups and sections using blank lines, comments, and whitespace to distinguish different parts of the code.
- **Meaningful comments:** Use comments to explain the purpose and intent of the code, but keep them concise and to the point. Avoid using comments as a substitute for clear and descriptive code.
- **Minimalism:** Keep your code concise and to the point. Avoid unnecessary code, as it can make the code harder to read and maintain.

By following these tips, you can produce code that is clear, readable, and easy to maintain, resulting in better code quality and faster problem resolution.

### Tools

Here are a few tools that can help you with code formatting and layout:

- **Code formatting tools:** `Prettier` or `Clang-Format` can automate the formatting of code to ensure consistency and readability.
- **Code editor plugins or extensions:** Visual Studio Code's `EditorConfig` extension can help you enforce consistent coding styles and practices.
- **Code linting tools:** `ESLint` or `JSLint` can catch issues with code formatting and help enforce coding standards.

These tools can help you maintain a consistent and clear code base, making it easier to read, understand, and maintain.

### Clean Code Examples

#### Example 1:

##### Bad Code:

```JS
var name="John Doe";function displayName(){console.log(name)}

```

##### Clean Code:

```JS
var name = "John Doe";

function displayName() {
  console.log(name);
}
```

#### Example 2:

##### Bad Code:

```JS
for(var i=0;i<10;i++){console.log(i)}
```

##### Clean Code:

```JS
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

### Clean Formatting

### Indentation:

- It is important to be consistent when choosing an indentation style for your code, as inconsistency can make your code confusing and difficult to read.
- There are a few decisions to make when determining your indentation style, including whether to use tabs or spaces, and if using spaces, how many spaces to use per indentation level. Most communities use either two or four spaces per indentation level.
- It is also important to configure your text editor to help you stick to your chosen style. When indenting code, it is helpful to think of it in chunks, like paragraphs in prose.
- Nested code should be indented one level deeper than the code that contains it.
- Different languages have different conventions for marking the start and end of nested blocks, such as curly braces or special keywords.
- It is important to be consistent in your use of these markers as well.

### Bracket Placement

- There are various ways that different programming languages specify the beginning and end of nested code blocks.
- Some languages, such as those inspired by C, use curly braces to mark the start and end of these blocks. Others use special keywords, such as "begin" and "end" or "do" and "end". Still other languages only require a keyword to mark the end of a block and allow the start of a block to be inferred.
- Each language community has its own conventions for where to place these markers, and there may be different styles even within a single language.
- It is important to be consistent in your use of these markers, as mixing different styles can make a codebase difficult to read.
- By using a consistent approach, readers can focus on the more important aspects of the code.

```C#
// C#
if (value)
{
    ...
}
else
{
    ...
}

```

```JavaScript
// JavaScript
if (value) {
    ...
} else {
    ...
}

```

### Line Wrapping

- It's important to format your code in a way that is easy to read, as this makes it easier for others to understand and work with.
- One way to do this is to limit the length of lines to a certain number of characters, such as 80.
- This is a common industry standard and can help prevent the need for readers to scroll left to right to view the code.
- When lines are too long, it can be helpful to wrap them by putting each parameter on its own line, and un-indenting the closing parenthesis to give a visual indication that the long method call is finished.
- It's also a good idea to add open and closing braces to if statements to make the code easier to understand.
- By applying these techniques, you can make your code easier to read and understand.

### Whitespace

- Whitespace is the use of blank spaces in code to make it more readable.
- Vertical whitespace refers to empty space between chunks of code, which can help visually indicate that certain pieces of code are related or belong together, similar to how paragraphs are used in written language.
- Horizontal whitespace is used to make code easier to read when reading from left to right, and indentation is a specific form of horizontal whitespace that appears at the start of a line.
- It's also helpful to add horizontal whitespace within a line, such as around boolean operators and after commas, to make the code easier to read.
- By adding both vertical and horizontal whitespace, you can make your code more readable and easier to understand.
- In particular, inserting blank lines after import statements, after each method, before return statements, before logical chunks of code, and around boolean operators and after commas can help improve the readability of your code.

```JavaScript
// Code without enough space
import React from "react";
const AddComponent = () => {
  const sum=(n1,n2) => {
    return n1+n2;
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <p>{sum(5,4)}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
export default AddComponent;

```

```JavaScript
// Code with enough space

import React from "react";

const AddComponent = () => {
  const sum = (n1, n2) => {
    return n1 + n2;
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <p>{sum(5, 4)}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default AddComponent;

```

### Comments

- Comments are sections of text in code that are ignored by the compiler when running a program.
- They are meant to be read by humans and can be a useful tool for explaining the purpose or intent of a program.
- However, not all comments are equally valuable.
- The best comments answer why questions, such as why a program exists or why it is implemented in a certain way.
- On the other hand, comments that merely repeat the code they are attached to provide no value and should be removed.
- If you feel that a comment is necessary to understand some code, it may be better to refactor the code to make it more readable instead of relying on a comment.
- Another type of comment that should be removed is a commented-out line of code, as it can be confusing to readers and can be stored in a source control system like Git.
- By focusing on adding comments that answer why questions and removing unnecessary or redundant comments, you can improve the readability and clarity of your code.

## Day 9: Reusable Code

### Reusable Code: Writing Code that Can be Easily Used Again

> Code that can be used again and again? Yes, please! Learn the techniques for writing reusable code for a more efficient development process.

Reusable code is a powerful tool for developers, allowing them to use the same code in different parts of a project or across different projects, saving time and effort. Writing modular, flexible, and well-documented code, utilizing design patterns, and managing code changes through version control systems are key to making code reusable. This leads to reduced development time, improved code quality, and greater collaboration.

### Tips and technique for Reusable Code:

- **Abstraction:** Use abstraction to hide implementation details and provide a high-level view of the code. This allows the code to be easily reused in different contexts.
- **Modularization:** Break code down into smaller, self-contained modules that can be easily combined and reused in different ways.
- **Documentation:** Write clear and concise documentation that describes how the code works and how it can be used. This helps other developers understand the code and use it effectively.
- **Test-driven development:** Use test-driven development to ensure that the code is correct and can be easily reused in different contexts. Write tests that cover all edge cases and verify that the code works as expected.
- **Error handling:** Write error-handling code that is robust and can handle unexpected situations. This makes the code more reusable and ensures that it can be used in different contexts without breaking.
- **Flexibility:** Write code that is flexible and can be easily adapted to changing requirements. Avoid hard-coding values or making the code tightly coupled to specific systems or frameworks.

By following these tips and techniques, you can write code that is easily reusable, flexible, and can be easily used again in different contexts. This leads to improved code quality, faster development times, and more efficient use of resources.

### Tools

There are several tools that can help you write reusable code, including:

- **Code libraries:** A collection of pre-written, tested, and documented code that you can reuse in your own projects. Examples include `lodash`, `jQuery`, and `React`.
- **Code generators:** Tools that automate the creation of code based on templates or specifications. Examples include `Yeoman`, `ScaffoldHub`, and `Plop`.
- **Code sharing platforms:** Platforms like `GitHub`, `GitLab`, and `Bitbucket` where developers can share and reuse code with others in the community.


### Clean Code Examples
#### Example 1:

##### Bad Code:

```JS
function calculateSum(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

function calculateDifference(a, b) {
    return a - b;
}

function calculateProduct(a, b) {
    return a * b;
}

function calculateQuotient(a, b) {
    return a / b;
}

```

##### Clean Code:

```JS
function performArithmeticOperation(a, b, operation) {
    switch (operation) {
        case '+':
            return a + b;
        case '-':
            return a - b;
        case '*':
            return a * b;
        case '/':
            return a / b;
        default:
            throw new Error("Invalid Operation");
    }
}
```

In the clean code example, the `performArithmeticOperation` function can be used to perform different arithmetic operations by passing the operation as a parameter. This makes the code more reusable as it can be used in different parts of a project or across different projects.

## Day 10: Exception Handling

### Exception Handling: Proper Techniques for Dealing with Code Errors

> Error handling is an essential part of code development. Get the proper techniques for dealing with code errors through effective exception handling.

Exception handling plays a crucial role in software development, as it helps to handle unexpected conditions and errors. Effective exception handling involves capturing exceptions, handling them in a correct manner, logging the errors, and using try-catch blocks to isolate and resolve issues. Adhering to best practices in exception handling results in improved code stability and reliability, preventing crashes and making it easier to diagnose and fix problems.

### Tips for Effective Exception Handling:

- **Use built-in exception classes:** Whenever possible, use built-in exception classes such as `ValueError`, `TypeError`, etc. If necessary, custom exception classes can be used.
- **Catch specific exceptions:** Only catch exceptions that you can handle and that are relevant to the specific part of the code. Avoid catching broad exceptions such as `Exception` or `BaseException`, as this may hide important error information.
- **Provide clear error messages:** Give informative error messages to help the user understand what went wrong and how to resolve the issue.
- **Use try-catch blocks:** Isolate and resolve issues by using try-catch blocks, making it easier to diagnose and fix problems.
- **Log exceptions:** Track errors and gather information by logging exceptions.
- **Clean up resources:** After handling an exception, clean up any resources or perform any necessary cleanup actions to prevent resource leaks.
- **Handle exceptions appropriately:** Handle exceptions correctly based on the type of exception and the context in which it occurred.
- **Test for exceptions:** Identify and resolve issues before deployment by testing your code for exceptions during development.
- **Avoid catching exceptions in non-exceptional cases:** Don't catch exceptions in cases where it's not unexpected for an exception to occur, as this can make the code harder to read and maintain.
- **Don't ignore exceptions:** If you can't handle an exception, don't ignore it by catching it and doing nothing. Let it propagate up the call stack.

By following these tips and techniques for exception handling, you can improve the stability and reliability of your code, making it easier to diagnose and fix problems. This leads to a more robust and trustworthy software.

### Tools

There are several tools that can help you properly handle exceptions in your code, including:

- **Debugging tools:** such as the `DevTools` in your web browser, or the built-in debugger in your text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE), to help you track down the root cause of exceptions and errors.
- **Error monitoring tools:** such as `Sentry`, `New Relic`, or `Rollbar`, which can alert you when exceptions occur in production and provide detailed information about the error, such as a stack trace and context about the environment where the error occurred.
- **Exception handling libraries:** such as the `try/catch statement` in JavaScript, or the `except` statement in Python, to explicitly handle exceptions and prevent them from crashing your application.
- **Logging frameworks:** such as `Winston` or `Bunyan`, which can be used to log information about exceptions, including the stack trace and any relevant context, to help you diagnose and resolve issues more quickly.

By using these tools and techniques, you can better handle exceptions in your code, ensure that your application continues to run smoothly, and quickly resolve any issues that may arise.

### Clean Code Examples

#### Example 1:

##### Bad Code:

```JS
function divide(num1, num2) {
  return num1 / num2;
}

console.log(divide(10, 2)); // Output: 5
console.log(divide(10, 0)); // Uncaught DivisionByZeroError: Division of a number by zero

```

##### Clean Code:

```JS
function divide(num1, num2) {
  try {
    if (num2 === 0) {
      throw new Error("Division by zero");
    }
    return num1 / num2;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error.message);
  }
}

console.log(divide(10, 2)); // Output: 5
console.log(divide(10, 0)); // Output: Division by zero

```

In the bad code example, the code will throw an uncaught error if the user tries to divide a number by zero. In the clean code example, the code uses a try-catch block to handle the error and returns a descriptive error message. This makes the code more robust and less prone to unexpected behavior.

## Day 11: Code Optimization

### Code Optimization: Making Code Faster & More Efficient

> Boost performance and maximize speed and efficiency in your code through code optimization techniques.

Optimizing code is a crucial step in delivering software with high performance. This involves finding ways to make the code run faster, consume fewer resources, and be more scalable. Techniques for code optimization include reducing the number of iterations and computations, limiting memory usage, and utilizing parallel processing to take advantage of multi-core processors. Code optimization ensures that the software is fast, responsive, and capable of handling large amounts of data.

### Here are some tips and techniques for code optimization:

- **Profile your code:** Use profiling tools to identify slow code areas and performance bottlenecks.
- **Use efficient algorithms:** Choose efficient algorithms and data structures to solve problems.
- **Reduce complexity:** Avoid overly complex code that is hard to understand and maintain.
- **Avoid unnecessary computations:** Minimize the number of computations required to get the desired result.
- **Use caching:** Store frequently used values in cache to avoid repeated computations.
- **Avoid global variables:** Global variables can slow down code and make it harder to understand and maintain.
- **Minimize I/O operations:** Minimize the number of I/O operations, as they can be slow and resource-intensive.
- **Use vectorization:** Use vectorization where possible to perform operations on multiple data elements at once.
- **Parallelize code:** Parallelize code where possible to take advantage of multiple processors and speed up computations.
- **Use built-in functions:** Use built-in functions and libraries for common operations, as they are often optimized for performance.

By implementing best practices for code optimization, developers can achieve maximum speed and efficiency in their code.

### Tools

There are several tools available for code optimization in `JavaScript`, including:

- **Bundle Analyzer:** A tool that analyzes the size of your code and provides recommendations for reducing the size of your code bundle.
- **Lighthouse:** An open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of your web pages.
- **Minify:** A tool that reduces the size of your code by removing unnecessary characters and optimizing the code structure.
- **UglifyJS:** A JavaScript parser, compressor, and minifier.
- **Webpack:** A module bundler that helps optimize your code by compressing and concatenating your code files.
- **Chrome DevTools:** A set of development tools built into the Google Chrome browser that can help you optimize your code.
- **Node CLI:** A command line interface for Node.js that provides tools for optimizing and profiling your code.
- **Benchmark.js:** A JavaScript benchmarking library that helps you measure the performance of your code and identify performance bottlenecks.
- **Debugging Tools:** Debugging tools such as the Chrome DevTools, Firefox DevTools, and other browser-based dev tools can help you identify and fix performance issues in your code.

### Clean Code Examples

#### Example 1:

##### Bad Code:

```JS
function findMax(numbers) {
  let max = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    if (numbers[i] > max) {
      max = numbers[i];
    }
  }
  return max;
}

```

The above code is a basic implementation of finding the maximum number in an `array`. However, it's not optimized and takes a long time for large arrays.

##### Clean Code:

```JS
function findMax(numbers) {
  return Math.max(...numbers);
}

```

The clean code uses the `Math.max` method to find the maximum number, which is much faster and more efficient than the previous implementation.

#### Example 2:

##### Bad Code:

```JS
function countOccurrences(array, item) {
  let count = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    if (array[i] === item) {
      count++;
    }
  }
  return count;
}
```

The above code is an implementation of counting the number of occurrences of a certain item in an `array`. It's not optimized and takes a long time for large arrays.

##### Clean Code:

```JS
function countOccurrences(array, item) {
  return array.filter(i => i === item).length;
}
```

The clean code uses the `filter` method to get all occurrences of the item, and then uses the `length` property to find the count, which is much faster and more efficient than the previous implementation.

#### Example 3:

##### Bad Code:

```JS
function calculateSum(numbers) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    sum += numbers[i];
  }
  return sum;
}
```

### Clean Code Examples

#### Example 1:

##### Bad Code:

```JS
let total = 0;
let count = 0;
let average = 0;

function addNumber(num) {
  total += num;
  count++;
  average = total / count;
}

function calculateSum(nums) {
  nums.forEach(num => {
    addNumber(num);
  });
}

calculateSum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
console.log(average);

```
This code has tightly-coupled functions, which makes it hard to reuse or test them individually. Additionally, the `calculateSum` function should not be modifying the global `total`, `count`, and `average` variables, as this can lead to unexpected behavior in larger codebases.

---

##### Day : Clean Code:

```JS
function calculateAverage(nums) {
  let total = 0;
  let count = 0;
  
  nums.forEach(num => {
    total += num;
    count++;
  });

  return total / count;
}

const average = calculateAverage([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
console.log(average);
```
In this code, the function `calculateAverage` is self-contained and does not modify any global variables. It takes in an array of numbers and returns the average, making it easy to reuse and test.

## Day 29: Design Patterns

### Design Patterns: Understanding & Implementing Design Patterns in Code.

> Design patterns for efficient coding. Master the use of design patterns to write better code and improve outcomes.

Design patterns are pre-established solutions to common design problems in software development. By providing a common language and framework, they make it easier to write scalable and maintainable code. Some of the most commonly used design patterns include the Model-View-Controller (MVC), Factory, and Singleton patterns. Understanding and applying design patterns is a crucial aspect of software development as it leads to more organized, reusable and maintainable code.

### Guidelines for Understanding and Implementing Design Patterns in Code:

- **Study common patterns:** Become familiar with the most frequently used design patterns and their applications.
- **Select appropriate pattern:** Determine the most suitable design pattern for the problem, considering performance, scalability, and maintainability.
- **Opt for simplicity:** Pick the simplest design pattern that meets the requirements.
- **Ensure consistency:** Use patterns consistently throughout the code for uniformity and maintainability.
- **Document the pattern:** Document the design pattern applied, to make it easier for others to comprehend the code.
- **Refactor regularly:** Regularly examine and refactor the code to ensure it follows design patterns and best practices.
- **Avoid over-reliance:** Don't overuse design patterns and keep the code straightforward, as excessive complexity can negatively affect understandability and maintainability.
- **Collaborate with team:** Collaborate with other team members to share knowledge and experiences, ensuring consistency in pattern usage.
- **Use patterns as guidelines:** Treat design patterns as suggestions instead of rigid rules and modify them as needed to better serve the project's specific requirements.

By following these guidelines, you'll effectively understand and apply design patterns in your code, resulting in organized, maintainable, and scalable code.

### Types of Design Patterns

- **Singleton pattern:** This pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Factory pattern:** This pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Observer pattern:** This pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **Decorator pattern:** This pattern dynamically adds/overrides behavior in an existing method of an object.
- **Command pattern:** This pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undo-able operations.
- **Facade pattern:** This pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex system of classes, library or framework.

#### Examples

### Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern is a design pattern used to ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a single point of access to this instance for all other objects.

```JS
class Singleton {
  static instance;

  static getInstance() {
    if (!Singleton.instance) {
      Singleton.instance = new Singleton();
    }
    return Singleton.instance;
  }

  constructor() {
    if (Singleton.instance) {
      return Singleton.instance;
    }
    this.singletonProperty = "This is a singleton property";
  }
}

const instance1 = Singleton.getInstance();
const instance2 = Singleton.getInstance();

console.log(instance1 === instance2); // Output: true
console.log(instance1.singletonProperty); // Output: "This is a singleton property"

```

In this example, the `Singleton` class has a static property `instance` which holds the single instance of the class. The static method `getInstance()` returns the instance, creating it if it doesn't exist yet. The constructor ensures that only one instance is created by checking if an instance already exists and returning it if it does.

### Factory Pattern

The Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

```JS
// Superclass
class Shape {
  draw() {}
}

// Subclasses
class Circle extends Shape {
  draw() {
    console.log("Drawing a Circle");
  }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
  draw() {
    console.log("Drawing a Rectangle");
  }
}

// Factory
class ShapeFactory {
  static getShape(shapeType) {
    switch (shapeType) {
      case "CIRCLE":
        return new Circle();
      case "RECTANGLE":
        return new Rectangle();
      default:
        return null;
    }
  }
}

// Client
const shape = ShapeFactory.getShape("CIRCLE");
shape.draw(); // Output: Drawing a Circle

```

In this example, the `Shape` class serves as the superclass and `Circle` and `Rectangle` classes serve as the subclasses. The `ShapeFactory` class serves as the factory and has a static method `getShape` that returns an object of the appropriate type based on the input shapeType. The client can then use the factory to create a specific shape object, which can then be used to call the `draw` method.

### Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern is a design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any changes to its state. It allows multiple objects to be notified of changes to the state of a subject, without coupling the observer objects to the subject or to each other.

```JS
class Subject {
  constructor() {
    this.observers = [];
  }

  subscribe(observer) {
    this.observers.push(observer);
  }

  unsubscribe(observer) {
    this.observers = this.observers.filter(obs => obs !== observer);
  }

  notify(data) {
    this.observers.forEach(observer => observer.update(data));
  }
}

class Observer {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  update(data) {
    console.log(`${this.name} received update: ${data}`);
  }
}

const subject = new Subject();
const observer1 = new Observer("Observer 1");
const observer2 = new Observer("Observer 2");

subject.subscribe(observer1);
subject.subscribe(observer2);

subject.notify("Hello World");

subject.unsubscribe(observer1);

subject.notify("Hello Again");

```

n this example, the `Subject` class maintains a list of observers and provides methods for subscribing and unsubscribing observers, and for notifying observers of changes to its state. The `Observer` class is a simple class that defines an `update` method that can be called by the subject to notify the observer of changes.

### Decorator pattern

The Decorator pattern is a structural design pattern that allows adding new behaviors to objects dynamically by placing them inside special wrapper objects.

```JS
class Car {
  drive() {
    return "Driving a car";
  }
}

class SportsCar extends Car {
  drive() {
    return "Driving a sports car";
  }
}

class AutoPilot {
  constructor(car) {
    this.car = car;
  }

  drive() {
    return this.car.drive() + " with autopilot";
  }
}

const myCar = new SportsCar();
const myAutoPilotCar = new AutoPilot(myCar);

console.log(myCar.drive()); // "Driving a sports car"
console.log(myAutoPilotCar.drive()); // "Driving a sports car with autopilot"

```

In this example, the `AutoPilot` class acts as a decorator that adds autopilot functionality to a `Car` object. The `SportsCar` class extends the `Car` class and provides additional functionality. The `AutoPilot` class takes a `Car` object as its argument and returns a new object with the autopilot functionality added to it.

### Command pattern

The Command pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to encapsulate a request as an object, allowing you to issue requests without knowing the receiver of the request. This can be useful when you want to decouple the sender and receiver of a request, and when you want to queue or log requests.

```JS
class BankAccount {
  constructor(balance) {
    this.balance = balance;
  }

  deposit(amount) {
    this.balance += amount;
  }

  withdraw(amount) {
    this.balance -= amount;
  }
}

class BankAccountCommand {
  constructor(account, action, amount) {
    this.account = account;
    this.action = action;
    this.amount = amount;
    this.success = null;
  }

  call() {
    switch (this.action) {
      case 'deposit':
        this.account.deposit(this.amount);
        this.success = true;
        break;
      case 'withdraw':
        if (this.account.balance >= this.amount) {
          this.account.withdraw(this.amount);
          this.success = true;
        } else {
          this.success = false;
        }
        break;
      default:
        throw new Error(`Invalid action: ${this.action}`);
    }
  }

  undo() {
    if (!this.success) return;

    switch (this.action) {
      case 'deposit':
        this.account.withdraw(this.amount);
        break;
      case 'withdraw':
        this.account.deposit(this.amount);
        break;
      default:
        throw new Error(`Invalid action: ${this.action}`);
    }
  }
}

const bankAccount = new BankAccount(100);
const depositCommand = new BankAccountCommand(bankAccount, 'deposit', 50);
const withdrawCommand = new BankAccountCommand(bankAccount, 'withdraw', 150);

depositCommand.call();
console.log(bankAccount.balance); // 150

withdrawCommand.call();
console.log(bankAccount.balance); // 150

withdrawCommand.undo();
console.log(bankAccount.balance); // 150

depositCommand.undo();
console.log(bankAccount.balance); // 100

```

In this example, we have a `BankAccount` class that represents a bank account, with deposit and withdraw methods. We then create a `BankAccountCommand` class that encapsulates a request to perform an action (deposit or withdraw) on a `BankAccount`. The `call` method executes the request, and the `undo` method undoes the request.

### Facade pattern

The Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex system. The idea is to create a single class, known as the Facade, which provides a simple interface for accessing the functionality of multiple, complex underlying classes. Here's a simple example in JavaScript:

```JS
class ComplicatedClassA {
  doSomethingA() {
    console.log("Doing something A");
  }
}

class ComplicatedClassB {
  doSomethingB() {
    console.log("Doing something B");
  }
}

class Facade {
  constructor() {
    this.classA = new ComplicatedClassA();
    this.classB = new ComplicatedClassB();
  }

  doSomething() {
    this.classA.doSomethingA();
    this.classB.doSomethingB();
  }
}

const facade = new Facade();
facade.doSomething();

// Output:
// Doing something A
// Doing something B

```

In this example, `Facade` provides a simplified interface to `ComplicatedClassA` and `ComplicatedClassB`. Instead of having to interact with both classes separately, the client can simply use the `Facade` class, which provides a single method `doSomething()` that calls both `doSomethingA()` and `doSomethingB()`.

## Day 30: Code Architecture


### Code Architecture: Best Practices for Designing Code Architecture.

> Establishing a strong base. Gain expertise in code architecture design with the best practices for creating a strong foundation for your code.

Code architecture refers to the overall design and structure of a software system. It lays the foundation of any software project and determines how the code is organized, structured, and linked. Best practices for code architecture design include modular design, separation of responsibilities, and code reuse. To ensure the success of the project, it's essential to plan the architecture from the beginning, considering the needs of the project, scalability, and maintainability.

### Tips for Designing Effective Code Architecture:

- **Separation of Concerns (SoC):** Dividing the code into different sections, such as UI, data storage, and business logic, to make the code more modular and easier to maintain.
- **Modular design:** Breaking the code into smaller, reusable components that can be easily tested, updated, and combined with other components.
- **High Cohesion:** Designing components so that they have a single, well-defined responsibility and are tightly related to one another.
- **Low Coupling:** Designing components so that they are loosely connected and can be easily changed or reused without affecting other parts of the system.
- **Abstraction:** Using abstract classes, interfaces, and other abstractions to encapsulate the implementation details of components and make the code more flexible and maintainable.
- **Dependency Management:** Managing the dependencies between components, such as using inversion of control (IoC) or dependency injection, to reduce the tight coupling between components.
- **Design Patterns:** Using well-established design patterns, such as Model-View-Controller (MVC), Factory Method, and Singleton, to create a more structured and reusable code architecture.
- **SOLID principles:** Following five design principles (Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion) to write clean, maintainable code.
- **Code Organization:** Organizing the code in a logical and easy-to-understand manner, such as using namespaces, packages, or folders, to make the code easier to navigate and maintain.
- **Documenting the architecture:** Documenting the code architecture, such as using UML diagrams, helps to communicate the design to other developers and make it easier to maintain and evolve the code over time.
- **Code refactoring:** Regularly review and refactor code to ensure adherence to best practices and design patterns.
- **Responsibilities separation:** Separate responsibilities such as data storage, business logic, and presentation to improve code organization and ease of maintenance.
- **Documentation:** Document the code architecture to assist others in understanding the code and making changes when necessary.
- **Architecture testing:** Test the code architecture regularly to ensure it meets requirements and can handle desired load.
- **Microservices:** breaking down applications into smaller, independently deployable services, allowing for greater scalability and flexibility in code architecture.


By following these best practices, you can design an effective code architecture that is well-organized, maintainable, and scalable.

### Tools

There are several tools available to assist with designing code architecture. Some of the most popular tools include:

- **Architecture Design Tools:** tools like `Visual Paradigm`, `Archi`, `Lucidchart`, `ArgoUML`, `yEd` and `PlantUML`, allow you to create visual models of code architecture, helping you understand the relationships between different components of your codebase.
- **Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):** IDEs, such as `Visual Studio` and `Eclipse`, provide features such as code refactoring and visualization, making it easier to manage and understand the architecture of large codebases.
- **Source Control Management (SCM) Systems:** SCM systems, such as `Git` and `SVN`, provide version control and collaboration on code, making it easier to manage changes to code architecture over time.
- **CI/CD Tools:** CI/CD tools, such as `Jenkins` and `Travis CI`, automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code, making it easier to manage and maintain code architecture in a scalable and efficient manner.
- **API Management Tools:** API management tools, such as `Kong` and `Tyk`, provide centralized management of APIs, making it easier to integrate code across multiple applications and services.
- **Message Queue Systems:** message queue systems, such as `RabbitMQ` and `Apache Kafka`, provide a way to manage communication between different services and components, improving the scalability and reliability of code architecture.
- **Load Balancing Tools:** load balancing tools, such as `HAProxy` and `NGINX`, distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of a service, improving the scalability and reliability of code architecture

### Clean Code Examples

#### Example 1

Modular Design: Breaking down your code into smaller, reusable modules makes it easier to manage and maintain. Each module should have a specific purpose and should be easy to test.

```JS
// example of a module for handling user authentication
const authentication = (function () {
  const validateUser = (user) => {
    // implementation of user validation logic
  };

  const logoutUser = (user) => {
    // implementation of user logout logic
  };

  return {
    validateUser,
    logoutUser,
  };
})();

```

#### Example 2

Separation of Concerns: Keeping different aspects of your code separated makes it easier to understand and maintain. For example, separating the business logic from the presentation logic makes it easier to make changes without affecting other parts of the code.

```JS
// example of separating business logic from presentation logic
const dataService = {
  // implementation of business logic
};

const view = {
  render: (data) => {
    // implementation of presentation logic
  },
};

```

#### Example 3

Single Responsibility Principle: Each component of your code should have a single, well-defined responsibility. This makes it easier to understand the code and reduces the likelihood of bugs.

```JS
// example of a component with a single responsibility
const calculator = {
  add: (a, b) => a + b,
  subtract: (a, b) => a - b,
};
```
