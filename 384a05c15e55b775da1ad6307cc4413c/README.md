# Clean Code: Securing Code



## Securing Code: Keeping Code Safe & Secure.

> Protect your code from potential threats. Learn about the strategies for securing code and keeping your code and applications safe and secure.

Securing code is a vital component of software development. In order to keep code safe and secure, proactive measures must be taken to prevent attacks and address potential security incidents.

## Commong Security Issue:

Here are some common issues related to "Securing Code: Keeping Code Safe & Secure."

- **SQL Injection:** An attack where malicious SQL code is injected into an application, allowing an attacker to access or modify data in the underlying database.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attack where malicious JavaScript is injected into a web page, allowing an attacker to steal sensitive information from users who access the page.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** An attack where a malicious website tricks a user into making a request to another website that they are already logged into, allowing the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user.
- **Broken Authentication and Session Management:** Weaknesses in how a website manages user authentication and session data can lead to attackers being able to access sensitive information or take over user accounts.
- **Insufficient Logging and Monitoring:** Failing to log and monitor access to sensitive data and systems can make it difficult to detect and respond to security incidents.
- **Insecure Cryptographic Storage:** Poorly secured cryptographic keys and other sensitive data can allow attackers to access and decrypt sensitive information.
- **Unvalidated Inputs:** Allowing user input to be used without proper validation can result in malicious data being used to compromise the security of an application.
- **Broken Access Control:** Improperly implemented access controls can allow unauthorized access to sensitive data or systems.

These are just a few of the most common security issues that can occur in code. It's important to stay up-to-date on the latest threats and best practices for securing code in order to keep your applications and data safe.

## Mitigating Methods for common issues related to securing code

To work on common issues related to securing code and keeping it safe and secure, you can follow the following steps:

- **Input validation:** Ensure that all user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent malicious data from being entered into your application.
- **Authenticate and authorize users:** Implement proper authentication and authorization procedures to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data or perform critical operations.
- **Encrypt sensitive data:** Store sensitive data, such as passwords and credit card information, in encrypted form to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Keep software up-to-date:** Regularly update all software components, including libraries, frameworks, and operating systems, to ensure that vulnerabilities are patched.
- **Use secure coding practices:** Adopt secure coding practices, such as avoiding hardcoded secrets, using secure random numbers, and avoiding buffer overflows.
- **Conduct code reviews:** Regularly conduct code reviews to identify potential security risks and make sure that best practices are being followed.
- **Monitor and log activity:** Monitor application activity and log important events to detect potential security incidents and respond promptly.
- **Test for vulnerabilities:** Regularly test your application for vulnerabilities using tools like penetration testing or security scans.

By following these steps, you can reduce the risk of security incidents and protect your code from malicious attacks.

## Tools

Here are a few tools for securing code:

- **SAST (Static Application Security Testing) tools:** Veracode, SonarQube, Checkmarx, etc.
- **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) tools:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, etc.
- **Code review tools:** Review Board, Crucible, Phabricator, etc.
- **Vulnerability scanners:** Nessus, OpenVAS, etc.
- **Penetration testing tools:** Metasploit, Core Impact, etc.
- **Encryption tools:** OpenSSL, GnuPG, etc.
- **Web application firewalls (WAFs):** ModSecurity, Cloudflare, etc.
- **Runtime application self-protection (RASP) tools:** Contrast Security, ImmuniWeb, etc.
- **Access control and authentication systems:** Okta, Auth0, etc.

These tools can help identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities in your code, and help you to keep your code safe and secure.
