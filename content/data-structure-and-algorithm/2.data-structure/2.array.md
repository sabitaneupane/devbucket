## Some Important Questions

In computer science, an array is a data structure that stores a fixed-size sequence of elements of the same type. The elements of an array are indexed by a numerical index or a key value, which starts from zero and goes up to the size of the array minus one. Arrays are commonly used in programming languages to store and manipulate collections of data.

Arrays can be implemented in various programming languages, including C, C++, Java, Python, and many others. In general, the memory space required for an array is allocated when the array is created, and the size of the array cannot be changed during runtime.

Arrays have several advantages, including constant-time access to elements (assuming the index is known), and efficient use of memory. However, arrays also have some limitations, such as the fixed size, which can make it difficult to add or remove elements from an array without allocating a new array and copying the existing elements.

There are various types of arrays, including one-dimensional arrays, two-dimensional arrays (also known as matrices), and multidimensional arrays. Some programming languages also provide specialized types of arrays, such as dynamic arrays, associative arrays (also known as maps or dictionaries), and sparse arrays.

Overall, arrays are a fundamental data structure in computer science, and they are used extensively in many algorithms and applications.

**Some of the most common operations in array are**

- **Accessing an element:** This operation allows you to retrieve the value of an element in the array based on its index. For example, to access the third element of an array named "myArray", you would use the expression "myArray[2]" in most programming languages, since array indices typically start from 0.

- **Updating an element:** This operation allows you to change the value of an element in the array based on its index. For example, to change the value of the third element of an array named "myArray" to 42, you would use the expression "myArray[2] = 42".

- **Adding an element:** This operation allows you to add a new element to the end of the array, increasing its size by one. Depending on the programming language, this can be achieved using various methods such as "push()" or "append()".

- **Removing an element:** This operation allows you to remove an element from the array, decreasing its size by one. Depending on the programming language, this can be achieved using various methods such as "pop()" or "remove()".

- **Sorting the array:** This operation rearranges the elements of the array in ascending or descending order based on their values. Depending on the programming language, this can be achieved using various methods such as "sort()" or "sorted()".

- **Searching for an element:** This operation allows you to find the index of a specific element in the array based on its value. Depending on the programming language, this can be achieved using various methods such as "index()" or "find()".

These are just a few examples of the common operations that can be performed on arrays. There are many other operations that can be performed on arrays, depending on the specific needs of a particular algorithm or application.

## Dynamic Arrays and resizing arrays

## Array Implementation

In JavaScript, arrays are used to store a collection of elements, which can be of any type, such as numbers, strings, objects, or even other arrays. Here are some examples of how to use arrays in JavaScript:

- Creating an Array:

  ```JS
  const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];
  ```

- Adding an element to an Array:

  ```JS
  myArray.push(5);
  ```

- Removing an element from an Array:

  ```JS
  myArray.pop();
  ```

- Accessing an element in an Array:

  ```JS
  myArray[0]; // returns 1
  ```

- Iterating through an Array:

  ```JS
  for (let i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {
    console.log(myArray[i]);
  }

  myArray.forEach(function(element) {
    console.log(element);
  });
  ```

- Finding the index of an element in an Array:

  ```JS
  myArray.indexOf(3); // returns 2
  ```

- Filtering an Array:

  ```JS
  const filteredArray = myArray.filter(function(element) {
    return element > 2;
  });

  // returns an Array containing [3, 4, 5]
  ```

- Sorting an Array:

  ```JS
  myArray.sort(); // sorts the array in ascending order
  myArray.reverse(); // reverses the order of the array
  ```

- Accessing the last element of an Array:

  ```JS
  myArray[myArray.length - 1]; // returns the last element of the array
  ```

- Adding elements to the beginning of an Array:

  ```JS
  myArray.unshift(0); // adds the element 0 to the beginning of the array
  ```

- Removing the first element from an Array:

  ```JS
  myArray.shift(); // removes the first element from the array
  ```

- Slicing an Array (returns a new Array containing a portion of the original Array):

  ```JS
  const slicedArray = myArray.slice(1, 3); // returns a new Array containing the elements at index 1 and 2
  ```

- Splicing an Array (modifies the original Array by removing or adding elements):

  ```JS
  myArray.splice(2, 1); // removes one element at index 2
  myArray.splice(1, 0, "new element"); // adds the element "new element" at index 1
  ```

- Concatenating Arrays:

  ```JS
  const newArray = myArray.concat([6, 7, 8]); // concatenates the original array with a new array containing elements 6, 7, and 8
  ```

- Mapping an Array (returns a new Array containing the result of applying a function to each element):

  ```JS
  const mappedArray = myArray.map(function(element) {
    return element * 2;
  });

  // returns a new Array containing [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
  ```

Arrays in JavaScript are very versatile and can be used for many different purposes, such as storing data, building lists or tables, and implementing algorithms.

### Question: Find the largest elements in an array

Given an array with all distinct elements, find the largest elements

> **Solution 1:**

```JS
const findLargestValue = (arr) => {
  let max = arr[0];
  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++){
    max = arr[i] > max ? arr[i] : max;
  }
    
  return max;
}


let arr = [10, 4, 3, 50, 23, 90]
console.log(findLargestValue(arr))

// Output:
// 90

// Time Complexity: O(n) 
// Space Complexity: O(1)

```
- The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the length of the array, since it iterates over each element in the array once. 
- The space complexity of the code is O(1), since it uses a constant amount of memory regardless of the size of the input array.

### Question: Find the largest three distinct elements in an array

Given an array with all distinct elements, find the largest three elements

> **Solution 1:**

```JS
// 1. sort algorithm in descending order
// 2. remove duplicate value if any
// 3. return the first three elements

const findLargestThree = (arr) => {
  // Sort in descending order
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
      if (arr[i] < arr[j]) {
        const temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[j];
        arr[j] = temp;
      }
    }
  }

  // Remove duplicates
  const uniqueArr = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (uniqueArr.indexOf(arr[i]) === -1) {
      uniqueArr.push(arr[i]);
    }
  }

  // Return the first three elements
  return uniqueArr.slice(0, 3);
};
console.log(findLargestThree([10, 4, 3, 50, 23, 90])); 

// Output
// [90, 50, 23]

// Time Complexity: O(n^2)
// Space Complexity: O(n)

```
- Time Complexity:
  - Sorting the array in descending order requires O(n^2) time complexity in the worst case, due to the nested loops used for bubble sort.
  - Removing duplicates requires O(n^2) time complexity in the worst case, due to the nested loops used for checking each element against the previously added unique elements.
  - Returning the first three elements requires O(1) time complexity.
  Therefore, the overall time complexity of this implementation is O(n^2).

- Space Complexity:
  - Sorting the array and removing duplicates are performed in-place, without creating any additional arrays or data structures, so they have O(1) space complexity.
  - The uniqueArr array used for storing the unique elements has a maximum size of n, so it has O(n) space complexity.
  - Therefore, the overall space complexity of this implementation is O(n).


> **Solution 2:**

```JS
// Using a loop to find the three largest values
const findLargestThree = (arr) => {
  let largest = -Infinity, secondLargest = -Infinity, thirdLargest = -Infinity;
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] > largest) {
      thirdLargest = secondLargest;
      secondLargest = largest;
      largest = arr[i];
    } else if (arr[i] > secondLargest && arr[i] !== largest) {
      thirdLargest = secondLargest;
      secondLargest = arr[i];
    } else if (arr[i] > thirdLargest && arr[i] !== largest && arr[i] !== secondLargest) {
      thirdLargest = arr[i];
    }
  }
  return [largest, secondLargest, thirdLargest];
}

// Output
// [90, 50, 23]

// Time Complexity: O(n)
// Space Complexity: O(1)
```

- Time Complexity:
  - The loop iterates through each element of the array once, so the time complexity is O(n).
  - Inside the loop, there are three conditional statements that execute in constant time, so they do not contribute significantly to the time complexity.
  - Therefore, the overall time complexity of this implementation is O(n).

- Space Complexity:
  - There are only four variables used throughout the function, regardless of the size of the input array, so the space complexity is O(1).
  - Therefore, the overall space complexity of this implementation is O(1).

- **Explanation:**
  - These three variables will store the largest, second largest, and third largest values in the input array. They are initialized to negative infinity so that any value in the input array will be larger.
  ```JS
    let largest = -Infinity, secondLargest = -Infinity, thirdLargest = -Infinity;
  ```
  - If the current element in the input array is larger than largest, then we need to update all three variables. The value of largest becomes the value of the current element, secondLargest becomes the previous value of largest, and thirdLargest becomes the previous value of secondLargest.
  ```JS
    if (arr[i] > largest) {
      thirdLargest = secondLargest;
      secondLargest = largest;
      largest = arr[i];
    }
  ```
  - If the current element is not larger than largest but is larger than secondLargest, then we only need to update secondLargest and thirdLargest. And to avoid duplicate value comparing value with largest.
  ```JS
    else if (arr[i] > secondLargest && arr[i] !== largest) {
      thirdLargest = secondLargest;
      secondLargest = arr[i];
    }
  ```
  - If the current element is not larger than largest or secondLargest but is larger than thirdLargest, then we only need to update thirdLargest. And to avoid duplicate value comparing value with largest and secondLargest.
  ```JS
    else if (arr[i] > thirdLargest && arr[i] !== largest && arr[i] !== secondLargest) {
      thirdLargest = arr[i];
    }
  ```
  - After iterating through the entire input array, we return an array containing the three largest values in the order of largest, secondLargest, and thirdLargest.
  ```JS
  return [largest, secondLargest, thirdLargest];
  ```
