## Maps in Data Structure

In computer science, a map is a data structure that allows for the storage and retrieval of key-value pairs. Maps are sometimes called dictionaries or associative arrays. The key in a map is used to uniquely identify the value associated with it, and each key can only be associated with one value. Maps are useful for tasks such as searching, indexing, and counting.

Maps can be implemented in many programming languages, and typically provide operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching by key. Some languages, such as JavaScript, support both Maps and objects, which are similar but have different use cases.

**Maps can be used in a wide range of applications, including:**

- Storing and indexing data in databases
- Implementing caching and memoization
- Processing large data sets in data science and machine learning
- Implementing search algorithms and data structures
- Implementing graph algorithms and data structures

## Maps Implementation
In JavaScript, maps are implemented using the Map object. Here are some examples of how to use maps in JavaScript:

- Creating a Map:

    ```JS
    const myMap = new Map();
    ```

- Adding a Key-Value Pair to a Map:

    ```JS
    myMap.set("key1", "value1");
    ```

- Getting the Value of a Key in a Map:

    ```JS
    myMap.get("key1"); // returns "value1"
    ```

- Checking if a Key is in a Map:

    ```JS
    myMap.has("key2"); // returns false
    ```

- Removing a Key-Value Pair from a Map:

    ```JS
    myMap.delete("key1");
    ```

- Getting the Number of Key-Value Pairs in a Map:

    ```JS
    myMap.size; // returns the number of key-value pairs in the map
    ```

- Iterating through a Map:

    ```JS
    myMap.forEach(function(value, key) {
    console.log(key + " = " + value);
    });
    ```

- Clearing a Map:

    ```JS
    myMap.clear();
    // removes all key-value pairs from the Map
    ```

- Creating a Map with Initial Key-Value Pairs:

    ```JS
    const myMap = new Map([
    ["key1", "value1"],
    ["key2", "value2"],
    ["key3", "value3"]
    ]);
    // creates a Map with the specified key-value pairs
    ```

- Checking if a Map is Empty:

    ```JS
    console.log(myMap.size === 0); // returns true if the map is empty
    ```

- Converting a Map to an Array:

    ```JS
    const myArray = Array.from(myMap);
    // returns an array containing the key-value pairs of the Map as arrays
    ```

- Checking if a Map Contains a Value:

    ```JS
    const containsValue = [...myMap.values()].includes("value1");
    // returns true if the Map contains the specified value
    ```

Maps in JavaScript can also contain objects or other maps as values, and the keys() and values() methods can be used to get arrays of keys or values in the map, respectively.

## Practice

### Question: Count the number of occurrences of each element in the array

Given an array of alpanumeric character, write a function to count the number of occurrences of each element in the array and return the counts as a map.

> **Solution 1:**

```JS
function countOccurrences(arr) {
  const myMap = new Map();

  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    const element = arr[i];
    count = (myMap.get(element) || 0 ) + 1
    myMap.set(element, count);
  }

  return myMap;
}

const arr = ['a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'd', 'd', 'e', 'e', 'e'];
const occurrenceCounts = countOccurrences(arr);
console.log(occurrenceCounts); 

// Output: 
// Map(5) { 'a' => 2, 'b' => 1, 'c' => 1, 'd' => 2, 'e' => 3 }

// Time Complexity: O(n) 
// Space Complexity: O(n)
```

- The time complexity of this implementation is O(n), where n is the length of the input array arr. This is because we are iterating through the array once and performing constant time operations for each element.

- The space complexity is also O(n), where m is the number of distinct elements in the input array arr. This is because we are storing each distinct element and its count in the myMap object.
