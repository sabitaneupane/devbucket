## Tuples in Data Structure

In computer science, a tuple is a data structure that represents a collection of elements, where each element can have a different data type. Tuples are similar to arrays, but whereas arrays have a fixed size and all elements must have the same data type, tuples can have a variable size and elements can have different data types. Tuples are sometimes also called records.

Tuples can be implemented in many programming languages, and typically provide operations such as indexing and slicing. Tuples are useful for tasks such as representing multiple values returned by a function, or grouping related data together. In some cases, tuples can also be used to represent immutable data structures.

Tuples can be used in a wide range of applications, including:

- Representing database rows and columns
- Representing values returned by a function
- Grouping related data together
- Representing immutable data structures

Some programming languages, such as Python and Ruby, include built-in support for tuples, while others provide libraries or modules that implement them. In languages where tuples are not natively supported, they can often be implemented using arrays or other data structures.

## Tuples Implementation

In JavaScript, tuples are not a built-in data structure, but they can be emulated using arrays or objects. Here are some ways to implement tuples in JavaScript:

- Using Arrays:

    ```JS
    const myTuple = [1, "hello", true];
    ```

- Using Objects:

    ```JS
    const myTuple = {0: 1, 1: "hello", 2: true};
    ```

- In both cases, the elements of the tuple can be accessed using indexing:

    ```JS
    myTuple[0]; // returns 1
    myTuple[1]; // returns "hello"
    myTuple[2]; // returns true
    ```

It's worth noting that JavaScript arrays and objects are dynamic and can be modified at any time, so the elements of a "tuple" implemented in this way can be changed after creation. Also, while tuples in other programming languages often have fixed size and type for their elements, this is not the case in JavaScript where arrays and objects can contain any type of value and can grow or shrink dynamically.

## Practice

### Question: Find all the unique triplets that sums 0

Given an array of integers nums, write a function to find all the unique triplets (a,b,c), such that a + b + c = 0. You may return the triplets in any order.

```
Input: nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]
Output: [(-1, -1, 2), (-1, 0, 1)]
Explanation: The sum of (-1, -1, 2) is 0 and the sum of (-1, 0, 1) is 0, so these are the valid solutions.
```

Given 

> **Solution 1:**

```Python
def threeSum(nums):
    nums.sort()
    result = set()

    for i in range(len(nums)-2):
        if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
            continue
        seen = set()
        for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
            complement = -nums[i] - nums[j]
            if complement in seen:
                result.add((nums[i], complement, nums[j]))
            seen.add(nums[j])
    return list(result)

# Input:
# nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]

# Output: 
# [(-1, -1, 2), (-1, 0, 1)]

# Time Complexity: O(n^2) 
# Space Complexity: O(n)
```

In this solution, we use a tuple (nums[i], complement, nums[j]) to represent a triplet. We add the triplet to the result set using the add() method.

Finally, we convert the result set to a list using the list() method and return it as the final result.

- The time complexity of the solution to the given LeetCode problem using tuples or arrays to represent triplets is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array. The outer loop iterates n-2 times, and the inner loop iterates n-i-1 times for each value of i, giving a total of (n-2) * (n-1) / 2 iterations. Sorting the array takes O(nlogn) time, but it does not dominate the overall time complexity because O(n^2) is larger than O(nlogn).

- The space complexity of the solution is O(n), which is used to store the seen set. The result set also takes extra space to store the unique triplets, but the maximum size of the result set is also O(n^2), so it does not affect the space complexity analysis. Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(n).
