## Sets in Data Structure
In computer science, a set is a data structure used to store a collection of elements, such as numbers, strings, or other objects. The key feature of a set is that it contains no duplicates - each element appears only once. 

Sets can be used to solve many different types of problems, such as 
- counting unique elements in a collection, 
- checking for membership of an element in a collection, or 
- finding the intersection or union of two collections.

There are several ways to implement sets in data structures, including arrays, linked lists, binary search trees, and hash tables. Each implementation has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on the specific use case and the properties of the elements being stored.

**Some common operations on sets include:**
- Adding an element to a set
- Removing an element from a set
- Checking if an element is in a set
- Finding the intersection of two sets (i.e., the elements that appear in both sets)
- Finding the union of two sets (i.e., the elements that appear in either set)
- Finding the difference of two sets (i.e., the elements that appear in one set but not the other)

Sets can be very useful for solving problems efficiently and effectively, particularly when dealing with large collections of data. They are often used in algorithms for data processing, machine learning, and other areas of computer science.

## Set Implementation
In JavaScript, sets are implemented using the Set object. Here are some examples of how to use sets in JavaScript:

- Creating a Set:
  
  ```JS
  const mySet = new Set([1, 2, 3, 4]);
  ```

- Adding an element to a Set:
  
  ```JS
  mySet.add(5);
  ```

- Removing an element from a Set:
  
  ```JS
  mySet.delete(4);
  ```
- Checking if an element is in a Set:
  
  ```JS
  mySet.has(3); // true
  mySet.has(6); // false
  ```

- Finding the intersection of two Sets:
  
  ```JS
  const set1 = new Set([1, 2, 3, 4]);
  const set2 = new Set([3, 4, 5, 6]);

  const intersection = new Set([...set1].filter(x => set2.has(x)));
  // returns a Set containing [3, 4]
  ```

- Finding the union of two Sets:
  
  ```JS
  const union = new Set([...set1, ...set2]);
  // returns a Set containing [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
  ```
  
- Finding the difference of two Sets:
  
  ```JS
  const difference = new Set([...set1].filter(x => !set2.has(x)));
  // returns a Set containing [1, 2]
  ```

- Iterating over a Set:

  ```JS
  mySet.forEach(function(value) {
    console.log(value);
  });
  ```

- Clearing a Set:

  ```JS
  mySet.clear();
  // removes all elements from the Set
  ```

- Converting a Set to an Array:

  ```JS
  const myArray = Array.from(mySet);
  // returns an array containing the elements of the Set
  ```

- Checking the size of a Set:

  ```JS
  console.log(mySet.size); // prints the number of elements in the Set
  ```

Sets in JavaScript can also contain objects or strings, and the size property can be used to get the number of elements in a set.

## Practice

### Question: Find all pairs of elements in the array

Given an array of integers, find all pairs of elements in the array that add up to a given sum. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and the sum is 6, the pairs of elements that add up to 6 are (1, 5) and (2, 4).

> **Solution 1:**

```JS
function findPairs(array, sum) {
  const seen = new Set();
  const pairs = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    const complement = sum - array[i];
    if (seen.has(complement)) {
      pairs.push([array[i], complement]);
    }
    seen.add(array[i]);
  }

  return pairs;
}

const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const sum = 6;
console.log(findPairs(array, sum)); 

// Output: 
// [[1, 5], [2, 4]]

// Time Complexity: O(n) 
// Space Complexity: O(n)
```

In this implementation, we first create an empty set called seen to store the elements that we have seen so far. We also create an empty array called pairs to store the pairs of elements that add up to the sum.

We then loop through the array and for each element, we compute the complement (i.e., the difference between the sum and the element). If the complement is in the set seen, then we have found a pair that adds up to the sum, so we add the pair to the pairs array. Otherwise, we add the element to the set seen.

Finally, we return the pairs array containing all the pairs of elements that add up to the sum.


- The time complexity of the findPairs function is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because we are looping through the array once and doing constant-time operations for each element. The operations include set lookups, additions, and array pushes, all of which have a time complexity of O(1) on average.

- The space complexity of the findPairs function is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because we are storing the elements that we have seen so far in a set called seen. In the worst case, all elements of the input array could be unique, so the set seen would need to store all of them. Additionally, we are storing the pairs of elements that add up to the sum in an array called pairs. The worst-case scenario is that all elements in the input array form a pair with another element to add up to the sum, in which case the pairs array would need to store n/2 pairs. Therefore, the space complexity of the function is O(n).

### Question: Get an array of unique common element from two array

Given two arrays of integers, write a function to find the common elements between them. The function should return an array of unique common elements in any order.

For example, given the following two arrays:

```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```

The function should return the following array:
```
[3, 4, 5]
```

> **Solution 1:**

```JS
function findCommonElements(arr1, arr2) {
  const set = new Set(arr1);
  const commonElements = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < arr2.length; i++) {
    if (set.has(arr2[i])) {
      commonElements.push(arr2[i]);
    }
  }

  return Array.from(new Set(commonElements));
}

const arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const arr2 = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7];
const commonElements = findCommonElements(arr1, arr2);
console.log(commonElements); 

// Output: 
// [3, 4, 5]

// Time Complexity: O(m+n) 
// Space Complexity: O(m)
```

In this implementation, we first create a Set called set containing the elements of the first input array arr1. We also create an empty array called commonElements to store the common elements between the two input arrays.

We then loop through the second input array arr2 and for each element, we check if it is in the Set set using the has() method. If it is, then we have found a common element, so we add it to the commonElements array.

Finally, we return an array of unique common elements by first creating a new Set from the commonElements array and then converting it back to an array using the Array.from() method. This step ensures that we remove any duplicate elements from the commonElements array.

- This implementation has a time complexity of O(m+n), where m and n are the lengths of the input arrays arr1 and arr2, respectively. This is because we are looping through each array once and doing constant-time operations for each element. The operations include set lookups and array pushes, both of which have a time complexity of O(1) on average.

- This implementation also has a space complexity of O(m), where m is the length of the first input array arr1. This is because we are storing the elements of the first input array arr1 in the Set set. The worst-case scenario is that all elements in the first input array are unique, so the Set set would need to store all of them.


### Question: Find all the unique triplets that sums 0

Given an array of integers nums, write a function to find all the unique triplets (a,b,c), such that a + b + c = 0. You may return the triplets in any order.

```
Input: nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]
Output: [(-1, -1, 2), (-1, 0, 1)]
Explanation: The sum of (-1, -1, 2) is 0 and the sum of (-1, 0, 1) is 0, so these are the valid solutions.
```

> **Solution 1:**

```JS
function threeSum(nums) {
  nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  const result = new Set();
  
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; i++) {
    if (i > 0 && nums[i] === nums[i - 1]) continue;
    const seen = new Set();
    for (let j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
      const complement = -nums[i] - nums[j];
      if (seen.has(complement)) {
        result.add([nums[i], complement, nums[j]]);
      }
      seen.add(nums[j]);
    }
  }
  
  return Array.from(result);
}
// Input:
// nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]

// Output:
// [(-1, -1, 2), (-1, 0, 1)]

// Time complexity:
// Space complexity:
```
In this solution, we use an array [nums[i], complement, nums[j]] to represent a triplet. We add the triplet to the result set using the add() method.

Finally, we convert the result set to an array using the Array.from() method and return it as the final result.


> **Solution 2:**

an optimized solution in JavaScript that uses the two-pointer approach to solve the problem

```JS
function threeSum(nums) {
  const result = [];
  nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; i++) {
    if (i > 0 && nums[i] === nums[i - 1]) continue;
    let left = i + 1;
    let right = nums.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
      const sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right];
      if (sum === 0) {
        result.push([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]]);
        while (left < right && nums[left] === nums[left + 1]) left++;
        while (left < right && nums[right] === nums[right - 1]) right--;
        left++;
        right--;
      } else if (sum < 0) {
        left++;
      } else {
        right--;
      }
    }
  }

  return result;
}
// Input:
// nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]

// Output:
// [(-1, -1, 2), (-1, 0, 1)]

// Time complexity: O(n^2)
// Space complexity: O(1)
```

This solution sorts the input array and then iterates over it using a **two-pointer approach**. The outer loop selects the first element of the triplet, and the inner loop searches for the remaining two elements using two pointers: left and right.

We skip over duplicates using the continue statement when nums[i] === nums[i - 1], nums[left] === nums[left + 1], or nums[right] === nums[right - 1].

We add the triplets to the result array, and finally, we return the result array.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), and a space complexity of O(1), as it doesn't use any additional data structures to store the triplets.
