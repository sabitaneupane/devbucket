# Data Structure

- Built-in Data Strucuture
  - **Strings:** A sequence of characters that represent text and are immutable in most programming languages.
  - **Array:** A collection of elements of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations, and accessed using an index or a pointer.
  - **Sets:** A collection of unique elements with no specific order, and supports set operations like union, intersection, and difference.
  - **Maps:** A collection of key-value pairs where keys are unique, and allows efficient lookup and modification of values based on keys.
  - **Dictionary:** A collection of key-value pairs where keys can be of any hashable data type, and allows efficient lookup and modification of values based on keys.
  - **Tuples:** An ordered collection of elements of different data types that are immutable in most programming languages.
- Custom data structure    
  - **Linked List:** A simple data structure that forms the foundation for more complex structures)
  - **Stacks:** A simple LIFO structure built on top of a linked list)
  - **Queues:** A simple FIFO structure built on top of a linked list)
  - **Tree:** A hierarchical structure that can be implemented using linked lists or arrays)
  - **Graph:** A network of nodes that can be implemented using adjacency lists, adjacency matrices, or other structures)
  - **Hash Table:** A key-value mapping data structure that uses hashing to achieve fast lookups)
  - **Heap:** A data structure used for efficient priority queue operations)
  - **Matrix:** A two-dimensional array used for representing grids and other structures)
  - **Grid:** A regular arrangement of nodes that can be traversed using various algorithms)
  - **Trie:** A tree-like data structure used for fast prefix searches and autocomplete)

## When to use array, set, map or dictionary

The choice of data structure (array, set, map, or dictionary) depends on the specific requirements of your problem and the operations you need to perform on the data. Here are some guidelines:

- Use an array if you need an ordered collection of elements and you need to access the elements by index. Arrays are also useful if you need to perform operations that modify the size of the collection (such as push, pop, shift, or unshift). If you need to check if an element is in the array, you can use the includes method in ES6.

- Use a set if you need an unordered collection of unique elements and you need to perform operations that check for membership or eliminate duplicates. Sets are also useful if you need to perform set operations such as union, intersection, or difference. If you need to iterate through the elements of the set, you can use the forEach method in ES6.

- Use a map if you need a collection of key-value pairs and you need to access the values by key. Maps are also useful if you need to perform operations that modify the size of the collection (such as set, delete, or clear). If you need to iterate through the keys or values of the map, you can use the keys, values, or entries methods in ES6.

- Use a dictionary if you need a collection of key-value pairs and you need to access the values by key, and you are working in a language that does not have a built-in map data structure (such as Python). Dictionaries are similar to maps, but they are implemented differently in different languages.

In summary, the choice of data structure depends on the requirements of your problem and the operations you need to perform.
