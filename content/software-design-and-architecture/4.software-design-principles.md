## Introduction

Software design principles provide guidelines for software developers to create high-quality, maintainable, and efficient software systems. They serve as rules that direct developers in building software systems that are adaptable, scalable, and easy to modify and understand. These principles are based on best practices and previous experience to assist developers in producing high-quality software that can be maintained and extended easily.

The following are some examples of design principles:

- **SOLID principles:** A set of five object-oriented design principles, including Single Responsibility Principle, Open-Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, and Dependency Inversion Principle.

- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** A principle that encourages designers and developers to keep systems and designs as simple as possible to prevent excessive complexity and maintenance issues.

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** A principle that urges developers to eliminate duplication in code and design to improve maintainability and lower the risk of errors.

- **YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It):** A principle that advises against adding features or functionality to a system that is not presently required or expected to avoid unnecessary complexity and effort.

- **LoD (Law of Demeter):** A principle that promotes loose coupling between objects by restricting interactions between them to only their immediate neighbors.

- **Separation of Concerns (SoC):** A principle that suggests dividing a system's different responsibilities into distinct modules or layers to promote modularity, maintainability, and flexibility.

- **Composition over Inheritance:** This principle states that code reuse should be accomplished via composition (i.e., combining smaller components to generate a larger one) rather than inheritance (i.e., creating a new class by extending an existing one). This promotes a more flexible and modular design that can adapt to changing requirements.

- **Encapsulate What Varies:** This principle advises developers to identify parts of the code that are most likely to change and encapsulate them into separate modules or classes. This promotes modularity and makes the code easier to maintain and extend.

- **Program Against Abstractions:** This principle encourages developers to create software that relies on abstractions rather than concrete implementations. This promotes flexibility and makes the code more adaptable to changing requirements or new technology.

- **Hollywood Principle:** This principle recommends that high-level modules call low-level modules, but not the other way around. This promotes loose coupling and makes the code more maintainable and extensible.

By employing these design principles, software developers can create software that is modular, flexible, and easy to maintain and scale. Design principles in software engineering are widely used and essential in building software that can adapt to changing requirements and remain relevant over time.
