Code maintenance is an integral part of software development. As software evolves and changes, it's essential to update and refactor the code to make sure it's readable, maintainable, and scalable. This requires a focus on continuous improvement, including practices like code review, testing, and optimization. By making code maintenance a priority, teams can ensure their code stays current and ready to meet the changing needs of users.

### Guidelines for Code Maintenance:

- **Organize and write readable code:** Structure code in a logical and easily understandable manner and use clear comments.
- **Use version control:** Keep track of changes and collaborate with team members using version control systems like Git.
- **Regularly review code:** Inspect code regularly to identify and fix potential issues.
- **Automate testing:** Use automated testing to catch and resolve bugs early.
