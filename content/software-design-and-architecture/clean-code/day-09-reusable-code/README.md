## Reusable Code: Writing Code that Can be Easily Used Again

> Code that can be used again and again? Yes, please! Learn the techniques for writing reusable code for a more efficient development process.

Reusable code is a powerful tool for developers, allowing them to use the same code in different parts of a project or across different projects, saving time and effort. Writing modular, flexible, and well-documented code, utilizing design patterns, and managing code changes through version control systems are key to making code reusable. This leads to reduced development time, improved code quality, and greater collaboration.

### Tips and technique for Reusable Code:

- **Abstraction:** Use abstraction to hide implementation details and provide a high-level view of the code. This allows the code to be easily reused in different contexts.
- **Modularization:** Break code down into smaller, self-contained modules that can be easily combined and reused in different ways.
- **Documentation:** Write clear and concise documentation that describes how the code works and how it can be used. This helps other developers understand the code and use it effectively.
- **Test-driven development:** Use test-driven development to ensure that the code is correct and can be easily reused in different contexts. Write tests that cover all edge cases and verify that the code works as expected.
- **Error handling:** Write error-handling code that is robust and can handle unexpected situations. This makes the code more reusable and ensures that it can be used in different contexts without breaking.
- **Flexibility:** Write code that is flexible and can be easily adapted to changing requirements. Avoid hard-coding values or making the code tightly coupled to specific systems or frameworks.

By following these tips and techniques, you can write code that is easily reusable, flexible, and can be easily used again in different contexts. This leads to improved code quality, faster development times, and more efficient use of resources.

## Tools

There are several tools that can help you write reusable code, including:

- **Code libraries:** A collection of pre-written, tested, and documented code that you can reuse in your own projects. Examples include `lodash`, `jQuery`, and `React`.
- **Code generators:** Tools that automate the creation of code based on templates or specifications. Examples include `Yeoman`, `ScaffoldHub`, and `Plop`.
- **Code sharing platforms:** Platforms like `GitHub`, `GitLab`, and `Bitbucket` where developers can share and reuse code with others in the community.


## Clean Code Examples
### Example 1:

#### Bad Code:

```JS
function calculateSum(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

function calculateDifference(a, b) {
    return a - b;
}

function calculateProduct(a, b) {
    return a * b;
}

function calculateQuotient(a, b) {
    return a / b;
}

```

#### Clean Code:

```JS
function performArithmeticOperation(a, b, operation) {
    switch (operation) {
        case '+':
            return a + b;
        case '-':
            return a - b;
        case '*':
            return a * b;
        case '/':
            return a / b;
        default:
            throw new Error("Invalid Operation");
    }
}
```

In the clean code example, the `performArithmeticOperation` function can be used to perform different arithmetic operations by passing the operation as a parameter. This makes the code more reusable as it can be used in different parts of a project or across different projects.
