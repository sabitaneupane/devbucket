## Don't trust the user 

- "Don't trust the user" is a security principle that applies to us as developers and it means that we should not assume that users know how to use our software in a safe and secure way. 
- It's not that we think users are unintelligent or uninformed, but rather that they may not be aware of potential security risks and could accidentally harm the system. 
- As developers, we are responsible for designing our software to limit the user's ability to cause harm, and we must implement security measures that protect against potential vulnerabilities. 
- For instance, if we allow user input, we should validate and sanitize it to prevent attacks such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting. 
- Additionally, we should restrict user privileges so that they can only perform actions that are necessary for their intended use of the software, and encrypt sensitive data to keep it safe from prying eyes.
- It is not the user's responsibility to fix the software, but rather our responsibility as developers to prevent unexpected actions and clean up input to avoid unwanted consequences.
- Ultimately, ensuring the security of our software is our duty as developers and should not be left to users to protect themselves.

## Validate and Sanitize

- As developers, it's important for us to validate and sanitize input fields in our digital applications to prevent attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS).
- Validation entails checking input data against specific criteria, while sanitization involves removing any unwanted or malicious code from the input data.
- It's crucial to perform both validation and sanitization on both the front end and back end of the application to ensure maximum protection against attacks.
- We can write custom validation and sanitization functions tailored to the specific needs of our application.
- The type of validation and sanitization needed may differ based on the coding language and environment being used.

## Limit Privileges

- When it comes to security, it is essential to control what actions users can perform within an application or system. This process is known as limiting privileges.
- By limiting privileges, we can prevent both accidental and intentional misuse of resources.
- To do this effectively, it's necessary to identify all possible actions within an application and create a structured access scheme based on user roles and capabilities.
- This approach can help to limit access and reduce the risk of security breaches.
- For example, in a web publishing application, users might only have access to public information and editing their profile, while administrators have full access, including the ability to add and remove users.
- To ensure security, we should default new users to the lowest possible access level and only grant them the privileges they need.
- More advanced applications may require the ability to create custom user roles with specific privileges based on the unique needs of the application.

## Encrypt Everything

- It is important to encrypt all online activities as a basic step towards securing our information and safeguarding our privacy.
- We should use end-to-end encryption while transferring information over any network, including 
  - accessing - cloud storage, 
  - committing files to a hosted version control system, 
  - logging onto any online service, and paying bills online
- Even free SSL certificates offer the same level of security as expensive ones, so there is no excuse for not using encryption.
- Developers should enforce encryption protocols and provide clear steps for users to re-establish encryption if it fails.
- Unencrypted data is vulnerable to theft and exploitation, so we should assume that someone is always watching our data flowing over the internet.

## Don't trust yourself

- It's essential to understand that as developers, we can't trust ourselves when it comes to security measures and testing.
- We must acknowledge this reality and seek help to identify bugs that may have been overlooked through automated and human usability testing.
- Incorporating **unit tests** and **automation test** into the development process can help catch errors early on, and user testing involving both security experts and regular users can reveal potential security issues.
- For example, a tester's input helped uncover a significant security flaw that the developer had missed, highlighting the need for multiple sets of eyes on the project.

## Public vs Private Data

- When it comes to computing, we need to understand the concept of public and private data. 
  - Public data can be accessed without authorization 
  - Private data requires authorization to access.
- It is crucial to consider the sensitivity of the data and who should have access to it.
- To ensure security in any application, we need to identify the type of data, whether it should be public or private, and who should have access to private data. 
- We should build in security measures such as encryption and the ability to switch public data to private or delete data.
- To accomplish this, we can create a spreadsheet and:
  - Add all data points to it.
  - Identify the data type.
  - Determine if the data should be public or private.
  - Identify who should have access to each data point.
- We should assume that all data, even public data, needs some level of protection.
- For example, credit card information should only be collected temporarily for each interaction.
## Field Verification

- In digital data collection and storage systems, it is necessary to verify and sanitize data to ensure that correct data is being inputted by users. 
- We can take the example of a weather app that requires a specific pattern of city name, country key, and state key for users to obtain weather data. 
- The verification process involves three layers:
  - **Client-side input verification** in HTML warns if the input does not match the required pattern using a pattern attribute.
  - **Client-side submit verification in JavaScript** checks if the submitted code matches the regex pattern and generates an error message if it doesn't.
  - **Server-side processing verification** is necessary as both HTML and JavaScript verification can be bypassed by someone who understands how they work. Server-side verification ensures that data matches the required pattern before processing it. 
- External APIs usually have built-in data validation, but we must catch and inform the user about error messages when invalid data is sent.

## Authenticate every interaction

- We recommend authenticating every interaction to increase the security of any development project.
- Different levels of authentication exist, including 
  - base level authentication, sign-in authentication, 
  - user account authentication with authorization levels, and 
  - validated user account authentication with signed authorization. 
- The level of authentication required depends on the **level of access** and **level of power** needed and the necessity of identifying the user account accessing the data. 
- It is crucial to collect only the necessary personal information to protect the user's identity while ensuring their authenticity. 
- Additionally, implementing two-factor authentication can further enhance the security of the system.

## Beware leaks in console

- We should be aware of potential leaks of sensitive information through the console when developing applications. 
- For instance, a news website leaked an authentication token through their console during beta testing. 
- To prevent this, we recommend using a code linter, printing protected data to the console only when necessary, removing private data logs, using a build tool that strips out console logs, and testing in production. 
- Additionally, modern development tools can help to warn and automatically strip out console logs.

## Assume your walls will be breached

- We should assume that our project's walls will be breached and take proactive measures to identify potential security breaches. 
- One way to achieve this is through conducting a premortem exercise, which involves imagining scenarios where a security breach has occurred and identifying the paths or methods attackers could use to achieve this breach. 
- The exercise concludes by documenting how to prevent each breach. 
- Utilizing the premortem exercise is a useful tool to surface potential security risks and address them before launching the project.
