# Clean Code: Code Testing



## Code Testing: Best Practices for Quality Assurance

> Quality assurance is the hallmark of clean code. Get the best practices for code testing for a more efficient and error-free development process.

Testing is an integral part of software development and helps teams validate their code for bugs, compliance with requirements, and performance. There are several types of testing, including unit, integration, and acceptance testing. To effectively test your code, it is crucial to establish clear processes and include testing in your development process from the start. By committing to comprehensive testing, you can deliver high-quality software that meets user needs.

### Best Practices for Effective Code Testing:

- **Plan tests before writing code:** Design comprehensive tests before beginning to code.
- **Automate testing:** Use tools to automate the testing process and save time.
- **Use multiple testing methods:** Incorporate different testing types, such as unit, integration, and acceptance, to cover all code aspects.
- **Clearly document test cases:** Write clear and understandable test cases.
- **Regular testing:** Incorporate testing into your development process and run tests frequently to identify and resolve bugs early.
- **Implement test-driven development (TDD):** Write code that is tested from the beginning using TDD.
- **Test with real-world scenarios:** Test your code using real-world scenarios to catch hidden bugs and enhance performance.
- **Monitor test results:** Regularly check test results and review progress for improvement opportunities.
- **Test across environments:** Test your code in multiple environments, including different operating systems and browsers, for compatibility.
- **Continuously improve testing:** Continuously evaluate and enhance your testing process for effectiveness and efficiency.

By following these tips and techniques, you can guarantee your code is error-free and meet quality assurance standards.

## Tools
Here are several tools that can assist with implementing best practices for code testing:

- **Code testing frameworks:** such as `Jest`, `Mocha`, or `Jasmine`, that automate testing and identify bugs before they reach production.
- **Code coverage tools:** such as `Istanbul`, that measure the extent of code coverage by tests and help identify areas that require more tests.
- **Test runners:** such as `Karma` or `TestCafe`, that automate the process of running tests and reporting results.
- **Mocking and stubbing tools:** such as `Sinon.js`, that allow for the replacement of parts of code with fake versions for testing purposes.
- **Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) platforms:** such as `Jenkins`, `TravisCI`, or `CircleCI`, that integrate with testing tools and automate the build, test, and deployment of code.
- **Debugging tools:** such as `Chrome DevTools` or the `Node.js debugger`, that assist in finding and fixing errors in code.
- **Test-driven development (TDD) frameworks:** such as `RSpec` for Ruby or `JUnit` for Java, that emphasize writing tests first and then building code to meet those tests.
- **Load testing tools:** such as Apache `JMeter` or `Gatling`, that test the performance of code under heavy loads.

By using these tools, you can implement best practices for code testing and ensure the quality and reliability of your code.


## Clean Code Examples

### Example 1:

#### Bad Code:

```JS
function calculateSum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```
This code does not have any tests to verify its correctness. If the code needs to be changed or refactored in the future, there's a risk that the change could break the code and lead to unintended behavior.


#### Clean Code:

```JS
function calculateSum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Test
describe("calculateSum", () => {
  test("returns the sum of two numbers", () => {
    expect(calculateSum(2, 3)).toBe(5);
  });

  test("returns the sum of negative numbers", () => {
    expect(calculateSum(-2, -3)).toBe(-5);
  });
});

```
This code has tests that verify the correctness of the `calculateSum` function. The tests cover different cases, such as the sum of positive and negative numbers, which helps to catch any errors or unintended behavior. By having tests in place, it makes it easier to refactor or make changes to the code in the future, as the tests provide confidence that the code is still working as expected.
