## Effective Commenting: Enhancing Code Readability with Comments

> Comments can make or break the readability of your code. Get the best practices for effective commenting to enhance the readability of your code.

Code comments play a crucial role in documentation, assisting human readers and machines to understand the logic and purpose of the code. Effective commenting involves writing clear, concise comments that accurately describe what the code does and using appropriate commenting conventions. Avoiding comments that don't add value is also important for effective commenting. By writing quality comments, developers can improve the overall quality of their code by making it easier to understand and maintain.

### Here are some tips for commenting your code:

- **Use meaningful comments:** Explain the purpose, function, and important details of the code.
- **Keep comments updated:** Regularly update comments to match changes in the code.
- **Avoid redundant comments:** Do not include comments that repeat information already in the code or provide no value.
- **Use standardized commenting style:** Adopt a consistent commenting style for the language or project for better readability and consistency.
- **Highlight key points:** Use comments to emphasize important points, edge cases, or assumptions in the code.
- **Comment complex code:** Add comments to complicated or difficult-to-understand code to make maintenance and updates easier.
- **Consider using pseudocode:** Before writing code, use pseudocode comments to explain its logic.
- **Document assumptions:** Document any assumptions made in the code to help others understand its behavior.
- **Include examples in comments:** Provide examples in comments to clarify the code's purpose and usage.

By implementing these strategies, your code's readability will improve, making it easier for others to comprehend and maintain through the addition of effective comments.

## Tools

There are several tools available to assist with effective commenting, including:

- **Code editor plugins or extensions:** With features such as automatic comment generation or comment insertion shortcuts.
- **Documentation generators:** Such as `JSDoc` or `Doxygen` that can automatically generate documentation from your code's comments.
- **Source control systems:** Such as `Git` that provide the ability to leave inline comments when committing changes, adding context and documenting changes.
- **Linting tools:** For example, `ESLint` that enforce good commenting practices, like mandating comments for certain code elements.

Using these tools can help you to write clear, concise, and well-documented comments that enhance the readability of your code.

## Clean Code Examples

```JS
class Vector2D {
  constructor(x, y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
  }

  magnitude() {
    // using the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the magnitude
    return Math.sqrt(this.x * this.x + this.y * this.y);
  }

  add(vector) {
    return new Vector2D(this.x + vector.x, this.y + vector.y);
  }

  subtract(vector) {
    return new Vector2D(this.x - vector.x, this.y - vector.y);
  }

  calculateDotProduct(vector) {
    return this.x * vector.x + this.y * vector.y;
  }

  scale(scalar) {
    // returning a new vector that is the original vector scaled by the input scalar
    return new Vector2D(this.x * scalar, this.y * scalar);
  }
}
```
